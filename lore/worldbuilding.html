                            <h2>Binary Realms</h2>
                            <h3>About</h3>
                            <p>A pair of two linked Realms, akin to binary stars. Ayka and Verdan are examples of such
                                Realms.
                                Mythology states that Ayka and Verdan were twin sisters, goddesses of life. Verdan was
                                peaceful and
                                mischievous, creating life and playing pranks on her sister. Ayka was more immature,
                                prone to violence,
                                and easily enraged by her sister's antics. However, this mythology is virtually
                                non-existent in present
                                time, with other gods of varying reality belonging to other religions appearing
                                throughout history.
                                They may have methods to travel between them.</p>

                            <h2>Ayka</h2>
                            <p>The Realm and setting of Shattered World, Realms and Crown, which for the past thousand
                                years has had centennial Shatterings
                                (with year 1000 being replaced by the Culling).</p>

                            <h2>Verdan</h2>
                            <p>The Realm and setting of SW2. Before settlers ventured from Ayka, Verdan had no known
                                sapient inhabitants, and is not cursed with Shatterings.</p>

                            <h2>Iteria</h2>
                            <p>A realm far away from the previously-mentioned binary realms. Only a couple of people
                                have ever managed to travel to this one by mistake. Some characters seem to have existed
                                in both.</p>

                                the Conqueror's influence, the portals backfired and spit void back out, melding with

                            </h1>
                            <p>Roughly two hundred years prior to the first Shattering, the Ender invaded the Nether,
                                attempting to terraform the dimension and wipe out the scattered clans of Piglins. For
                                many years, the Piglins were decimated, before eventually uniting under a singular clan.
                                This clan's leader won several key battles, and in time the united front of the Piglins
                                drove out the invaders.</p>

                            <h1>The Aftermath</h1>
                            <p>The hero of the war was made king of the newly united Piglins across the Nether. However,
                                he was only suited to wartime, and his kingdom fell to revolt and civil war not two
                                decades after being founded. After being imprisoned by the enraged population, he was
                                set to a public execution. However, he went missing from his cell not long before it was
                                scheduled, and was not heard from again. The Bastions created for the war fell into
                                disrepair, now only inhabited by those who dare stake a claim over the buildings. Many
                                Piglins dare not try, considering the old war bases cursed. Warped Forests are a result
                                of Ender terraforming, a hybridization of chorus and crimson.</p>
