                    <p>
                        Born before the time of Arthur of Benton, Alexander grew up in the parted nation that was
                        the
                        once-united Kingdom Valdelor. Growing up, he saw how only a few of the Valdelorians had
                        really
                        adapted to the constant state of change that the kingdom was in, and some tried to, but most
                        had
                        given up. Needless to say, most of them knew a leader to unify them all would be needed to
                        end
                        the chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then Arthur of Benton appeared. He brought the long-desired peace but was unable to get rid
                        of
                        the chaos at first. To get rid of the chaos, he made a plan: he gave lords and governors
                        land to
                        rule how they seemed fit, with the limitations only being his word and his taxes. Most of
                        the
                        people who were made governors had not been in positions of power before, but that did not
                        stop
                        him. One of the people to become governor was Alexander's father, who was given the lands
                        right
                        next to the capital city to rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arthur of Benton, however, stepped back and retired soon after his goal of unifying Valdelor
                        had
                        been accomplished. A new king was to be chosen; the governors and lords had to decide
                        quickly,
                        since without a king, the kingdom threatened to fall apart once more. Those who had a say in
                        the
                        decision met in the capital city the night Arthur stepped back and chose Alexander to be the
                        new
                        king. The crowning ceremony was held the next morning in quite a rush, as to not give anyone
                        a
                        chance to even notice that there was no king. Alexander's father died of old age only a week
                        later, but the people of Valdelor had trust in the governor's decision, much to Alexander's
                        benefit.

                        Amadeus’s parents were born in Shuri during the time of war but escaped to the south. They
                        managed to make it across the sea and into Valdelor but died soon after. When Amadeus was
                        wandering around Valdelor, he was picked up by Alexander. Amadeus was infinitely grateful
                        and,
                        in turn, became very loyal. When Alexander became King, Amadeus was promoted to a lord and
                        granted a piece of land. He now takes care of that land and is striving to help all who
                        enter
                        it.

                        Arctos is a wanderer who occasionally shows up in civilization. He answers to no kingdom but
                        claims to be a member of a group called the Lorekeepers, whom he claims have existed since
                        time
                        began. He will trade with people he encounters and is happy to sit and enjoy a meal and a
                        story
                        with them. If asked by a town guard, he will turn in his weapons, but he will have them
                        close to
                        hand when he is in the wilderness. Occasionally, he will request that copies of books be
                        turned
                        over to him for the Lorekeeper's archives. No one knows where these are, but he does not
                        have
                        them on him the next time he is seen. Sometimes he will not be seen for ages, then wander
                        into a
                        town or city without a word. He knows many things and tells few.

                        "Atai" or "値" was born in the lands of "下ら" or "Kutara". When Atai was 5 years old, his
                        father
                        passed away due to an infection in a wound caused by the war. When Atai was 12, peace was
                        declared, and he thought he could now focus on other things instead of trying to enter the
                        army
                        to get extra perks like food, water, and shelter, which were hard necessities to be found

                        the wars.

                        At the age of 14, Master Builder Zain took responsibility to teach Atai about building,
                        which he
                        was very passionate about. He lit the fire in Atai's heart to become the Master Builder when
                        he
                        would grow up. His mom "結愛" or "Yua" was an alchemist, so he learned to harness some of the
                        powers of the elements and make potions out of them. He even knew some basic fighting
                        because
                        his father was a man of the army and had taught him self-defense and basic fighting
                        techniques.
                        He even loved to go out and explore.

                    <p>
                        Once when he was roaming, he saw what seemed to be a village. He felt that he was ejected by
                        something and fainted. Upon waking up, he seemed to be lying on a shore with fishermen who
                        were
                        waiting for him to wake up in their huts. He got scared and scurried out of there and saw a
                        city
                        nearby. He asked a few citizens, and the country seemed to be called Shuri. He immediately
                        wrote
                        a letter to his mom to tell her that he was alive and safe and how a bunch of fishermen had
                        saved his life and he had found a country called Shuri. He decided to settle there and start
                        a
                        new life.

                        Azear is quite private, like most Zurtuns, especially with his solitary upbringing. He
                        doesn't
                        share his past with outsiders very often. However, he doesn't hide his Oracle status and

                        connection and devotion to the gods. As a knowledge seeker himself, Azear will gladly share

                        Bétulin le Fey is the wildest of leFey brothers. He is good at fighting and brawling. Like
                        his
                        brothers he likes farming and gardening.

                        He was the yougest child of Lillie Àlcasara and Thomas le Fey II. He always wanted to be a
                        warrior but he became a lumberjack. He cuts wood in Valdelor's great forests and works for
                        his
                        brother, Thomas le Fey III.

                    <p>
                        The Abomination was known by many as an old fairy tale, it was a boogeyman. Something to
                        tell
                        children when they wouldn't finish their meals or go to bed on time. The stories say he was
                        an
                        old fool, driven to use dark magic but went mad from it, and it left him with a lust for
                        blood
                        ever since. They say it's been around for years, having existed long before the people
                        travelled
                        to the new world. But surely, the Abomination isn't real, just an old tale to spook the
                        young
                        and naïve... right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Ender Abomination often served the different leaders of Valdelor through the ages,
                        working
                        in labour jobs like mining or lumber chopping in secret under the veil of night. It was seen
                        as
                        a wild beast, something that would do work for little to no pay, and something that
                        terrified
                        the peasants who saw it. The leaders offered it protection from the outside world, as when
                        it
                        was not aggressive, it tended to be skittish, not unlike the behaviour of a beaten dog. Once
                        the
                        monarchy fell, the Abomination was passed around different lords and ladies, used as cheap
                        labour by whoever’s county was suffering the most, and once the new monarch was put in
                        place, it
                        would often serve them. It was always seen as a beast, an abomination, and no one ever truly
                        saw
                        what it was; a man. A man with a fractured mind, a broken heart, and a mangled body, trying
                        to
                        do whatever it took to survive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Abomination is a mad soul, constantly switching how it behaves. It is often docile,
                        almost
                        curious in nature, though is known to switch to pure rage and hatred in the blink of an eye,
                        lashing out violently at whatever's close, or what has angered it. Because of this, it is
                        difficult to tame and rely on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Abomination, when treated right, is fiercely loyal to who it considers it's master,
                        willing
                        to die for them. However, if it finds it's master no longer worthy of it's respect, it will
                        become enraged and attempt to slaughter them. The Abomination, though dangerous, cannot
                        fight
                        with skill and will instead throw punches blindly and wildly. It is difficult to be provoked
                        through conventional methods, (though if stared at will react violently), and will prefer to
                        avoid confrontation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the Abomination’s greatest strengths is it's apparent immortality. While it can be
                        injured, it seems it can heal almost any wound short of dismemberment. One of it's greatest
                        weaknesses, however, is speech. The Abomination’s speech is usually distorted and
                        incoherent,
                        sounding somewhere between the speech of people and the odd language of the Endermen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the Abomination has been known to speak in a strange language not known to mankind
                        or
                        the Ender, and sometimes even speak in the common tongue. Though, this is not to say it
                        cannot
                        communicate. One of the Abomination’s most human attributes is it’s joy of writing, and it
                        will
                        often write messages on signs or books to communicate, if it’s feeling docile, that is. It
                        will
                        also avoid sunlight if possible, but does not suffer any ill effects from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Abomination lacks a wide variety of skills, with it’s only real talent being it’s
                        ability to
                        work longer and harder than the average man, though as previously mentioned, enjoys writing.
                        The
                        creature also enjoys building, but has a strange sense of what is appealing or logical when
                        it
                        comes to construction, often using bizarre materials in it’s personal builds, though if
                        given
                        instructions, will build structures how it’s told.

                        Geralt has always been a cold-blooded killer. His decisions are based on cold calculation
                        and
                        complicated plans. He is the greatest commander and fighter from the North to the South of
                        the
                        Verdan lands, but he always needs to think a lot before he can make any decisions.

                        There is a rumor that he is the grandson of Elrond, the True King of Valderlor. He spent his
                        younger years escaping from the revolutionaries, the men who killed his whole family. He was
                        raised by a blacksmith named Galamoir. He killed his first man when he was only five years
                        old,
                        of course, because of an unfortunate accident.

                    <p>
                        After the revolution started, he was put to his hardest test. He had a choice to make: be
                        killed
                        with his own family or run away and stay alive. He chose the second option, and after all
                        that,
                        he met the blacksmith. He wants to get revenge on his old enemies to this day. He is a good
                        fighter and commander, but he has to think a lot before his decisions.

                        He is a very charming and charismatic person. He is terrified of getting assassinated.

                    <p>
                        Born as a noble in a big country created after the fall of Valdelor, Gustavus had a life
                        perfectly paved ahead of him. For 16 years he lived the typical noble life. However, one day
                        his
                        parents were murdered, and Gustavus saw himself surrounded by other nobles envious of his
                        wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surviving a few assassination attempts, Gustavus became unable to support such a life. He
                        set
                        his properties ablaze and forged his own death, and ran away with what he had left. He
                        passes
                        through many other states, and eventually found a man who gave him shelter. That man war
                        Arthur
                        of Benton himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Swearing loyalty to his new king, Gustavus promised to never rest until Arthur reunited
                        Valdelor. After fighting countless battles side by side, Gustavus was on the first row when
                        he
                        saw his king and friend sit on the throne of a new, united Valdelor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, after Arthur stepped down from his throne, Gustavus turns away from his previous life
                        of
                        iron and blood, and finds a peaceful home on the kingdom he now calls "home".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trained for combat, he excels as a skilled marksman and maintains an acceptable level of
                        hand-to-hand combat prowess. He possesses adept social skills, fostering good relationships
                        with
                        others. However, advancing age has diminished his combat abilities compared to his prime.
                        Nonetheless, he compensates with a wealth of knowledge accumulated over a lifetime of
                        experiences and travels.

                    <p>
                        Josef comes from a merchant family in the Kingdom of Valdelor. His family struggled to find
                        good
                        legal business within the turmoil of constant governmental changes. So, they turned to the
                        black
                        market and heavily exploited the crippled state of government. However, all of this came to
                        a
                        close when Arthur of Benton rose to power. There was no more turmoil to exploit, and all
                        criminals were punished, Josef’s parents included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Josef will always remember the day he saw them get beheaded. He was in his teens, with no
                        real
                        knowledge of the crimes his parents had committed. For this reason, he was spared, yet he
                        still
                        received a front-row seat to his parents' execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some townsfolk called it the ‘splash zone’ as many of the front-row onlookers would be
                        drenched
                        in blood after beheadings, which Josef found out firsthand on that day. The cool moist blood
                        had
                        rained upon his face. He wouldn’t forget this day. And Arthur of Benton made sure he
                        wouldn’t
                        either, making Josef pledge loyalty and service to the crown of Valdelor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since that date, Josef has become a farmer with two of his friends, Gustavus and Marcus.
                        While
                        also secretly re-establishing some of the ties his parents had within the black market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Josef hopes to serve Valdelor by becoming a very wealthy man and bring success to all the
                        people
                        in the kingdom. He also wishes to fulfill the dream of a world which follows Oberon, the one
                        true god of Verdan.

                        Kiyoko of Shuri was a curious girl, even in the midst of war she was always cheerful, trying
                        to
                        keep people’s spirits up. As soon as she was old enough, she trained with a sword and bow,
                        aspiring to be a samurai for her queen someday, one who would protect the peace. However,
                        behind
                        the cheerful facade was a grieving child. During the war, something happened that changed
                        her
                        life. Her entire family fought in the war, and she wanted to protect them, but when they
                        needed
                        her most, she failed them. She was unable to take the life of an enemy until she saw her
                        family
                        murdered in front of her at the young age of 16. That’s when she decided never to show her
                        grief
                        to anyone and to help people if they were in a tough place.

                    <p>
                        Lucas lived in ruins of kurgan as there is a very very long relationship to a kurgan
                        (unknown
                        which kurgan). Food and supplies were getting low and there were hardly any animals around
                        because of global warming and weren't given a chance to repopulate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About 3 years before, the first brave souls entered the portal, but lucas and his family
                        were
                        unsure if it was properly safe so they decided to not go in. Lucas's father trained lucas
                        and
                        his brother to hunt, start fires, advanced survival and handy building techniques. After 1
                        more
                        year they were forced to eat and live off berries and still water which led to Lucas's
                        mother to
                        become extremely ill so lucas dedicated alot of time to helping his mother, after another
                        month
                        lucas gained courage to go into the portal for about a week and bring back and forth
                        supplies as
                        if he didn't they would all starve to death or die of frost bite. After 2 weeks of
                        preparation,
                        lucas went through, it went amazing, there was so many animals, the water was crystal clear
                        and
                        the land was so so green.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a few days of going back and forth, lucas decided to walk out much further in seek of
                        a
                        new home for him and his family, he found a kingdom that was willing to help them. So lucas
                        happily agreed and went to get his family. On the way back to the portal Lucas noticed there
                        was
                        no portal, just rubble from the portal. Lucas was trapped there, without his family, all he
                        could think about was if his family is okay. He stayed near the portal for a week in hope it
                        might be fixed some how... For those 7 nights, lucas got very little sleep from the thoughts
                        and
                        dreams about his parents and brother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of the lack of sleep lucas felt really bad and attempted to rebuild the portal, it
                        was
                        hopeless... Lucas was incredibly sad and felt like a pile of shit, he even attempted suicide
                        multiple times by hanging himself but the rope was too strong the fist 2 times and the last
                        time
                        a man saw him and freed him from the noose he made. Lucas felt it was hopeless and God
                        wanted
                        him to live so he gained courage and went to the kingdom and stayed there, he felt so much
                        better there, he could actually say he was happy.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Becoming a Nomad</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lucas was out hunting in Valdelor, just like any other day. As he wandered through the
                        forest,
                        he noticed an unusual shadow on the hill. It was devouring a dead wolf. Judging from its
                        appearance, this... thing wasn't very friendly. He quickly turned the other way, thinking
                        nothing more of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, he heard a piercing scream that made his ears ache and his skin crawl. It sounded
                        like a
                        girl in distress. Without hesitation, he dropped everything and sprinted over the hill.
                        Unfortunately, he tripped over a concealed rock hidden in the leaves and tumbled down,
                        hitting
                        his head on a tree at the bottom. Darkness enveloped him as he lost consciousness,
                        succumbing to
                        a concussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he awoke, he found himself in a pitch-black cave, cold and restrained against the wall.
                        He
                        called out for help, but received no response. Then, a strange, incomprehensible voice began
                        speaking, sending shivers down his spine. Its abstractness was indescribably unsettling.
                        Lucas
                        remained frozen in fear, unable to move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After what felt like an eternity, two luminous eyes pierced the darkness. They resembled
                        either
                        cat or owl eyes; he couldn't discern in the dimness. Suddenly, everything became blindingly
                        bright, and he found himself back in his house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Waking up again, Lucas went to fetch a drink, only to be struck by a headache so intense it
                        brought him to his knees. After a couple of minutes, the pain subsided, but he felt markedly
                        different. Reflecting on the events of the previous day (or what he assumed was yesterday),
                        he
                        realized he could understand the creature's speech, though its words were unrepeatable. A
                        profound sense of urgency washed over him, compelling him to leave as quickly as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following days, he info-textrmed his king of his departure for unknown reasons,
                        packed his
                        belongings, and set off into the unknown.

                        Lucas Knox was the son of a rebellious lord in the northwest of Valdelor. During this
                        rebellion,
                        there was a massive failure. His father and older brother were killed, Knoxhall was burned,
                        and
                        the remaining lands he might have inherited were seized by the crown. Lucas was not involved
                        in
                        the fighting and had to watch as his noble house was torn apart piece by piece. An ambitious
                        thought burned in him: he would restore the glory of House Knox.

                        Marcus, formerly known as Markvard, grew up with his mother. He never knew his father, but
                        he
                        always heard rumors about him, some portraying him as weak, others as strong. Despite not
                        being
                        the best fighter, Markvard trained diligently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the portal was discovered, Markvard and his mother stepped through to explore new
                        lands,
                        settling in a small village not too far from the portal. However, when wars erupted, the
                        village
                        suffered harshly. Markvard and the other villagers attempted to fend off the attacks but
                        eventually had to flee. Separated from his mother during the chaos, Markvard searched for
                        her in
                        vain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Realizing he couldn't survive alone, he set off in search of food. After nearly two days of
                        hunting, he stumbled upon a settlement, where he was given food, shelter, and new clothes
                        after
                        explaining his plight to the guards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Markvard asked the king if he could stay, and he was welcomed into the Valdelorian kingdom,
                        where he became known as Marcus.

                        In the times of Arthur of Benton, the le Fey family held only remnants of their former
                        lands.
                        They were one of the few families that stood up against the Valdelor pact. During the
                        unification of the United Kingdom of Valdelor, the main le Fey branch died out in an attempt
                        to
                        hold their piece of land. The bloodline of le Fey continued in Thomas le Fey III.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the siege of Marvalen Castle, Ælven and Mersèl moved out, while Ælysen worked to earn
                        the
                        trust of the new central government under Arthur of Benton to save Son le Ii property in
                        Grand
                        Est. Ælven Son le Ii (nee Àlcasara) gathered le Fey knowledge and taught the future Son le
                        Ii
                        heiress while her mother was busy with politics in the Valdelor capital. Mersèl later
                        started to
                        learn "Marvalenicca" by Mersèn Son le Ii, son of Æle le Fey. It’s the tome of ancient
                        practices,
                        done for the enrichment of the inner spiritual world and betterment of the connection with
                        the
                        outer natural world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After many years spent in the far Grand Est, Mersèl finally arrived in Valdelor Metropolis,
                        where she studied and learned the art of arguing from the best tutors of the southern
                        kingdom.
                        Along with great education, the young heiress earned the nickname "iron wolf" for her tough
                        personality and strong belief in Valdelor supremacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In her teenage years, she was a friend of other noble sons and daughters, especially close
                        with
                        le Fey brothers from the paternal branch of the greater le Fey dynasty. Later, the
                        connection to
                        high society helped Mersèl to feel comfortable near any powerful men or women, be it the
                        king or
                        a foreign diplomat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, upon returning home, Mersèl’s heart was broken after the death of her father,
                        Ælven.
                        Due to this, Ælysen was forced to return to Grand Est, ending her career as a diplomat. The
                        tragedy led Son le Ii daughter to go back to the Valdelor Metropolis and work for new king
                        Alexander so the Son le Ii family could possess the position of power as it should by the
                        right
                        of ancient blood and as an honor to her late father.

                    <p>
                        Born into a financially stable family, Motoki was raised as a humble gentleman by his
                        father,
                        who held a prestigious position among the nobles due to his architectural prowess. The
                        devoted
                        father constructed palaces and cities, all the while spending time conversing and playing
                        with
                        young Motoki, imparting invaluable life lessons and striving to mold him into a remarkable
                        individual, perhaps even surpassing himself.

                    <p>
                        Tragically, their idyllic father-son moments came to an abrupt end during the revolutions
                        and
                        wars. At the tender age of ten, Motoki's land was besieged by a marauding crowd, breaching
                        the
                        sanctity of their home. In a selfless act, Motoki's father sacrificed himself, succumbing to
                        a
                        fatal stab wound while protecting his son.

                    <p>
                        Before long, the royal army arrived, rescuing the remnants of what and who remained,
                        discovering
                        Motoki stranded amidst the ruins of his home. Moved by compassion, his father's friend, the
                        War
                        and Defense Governor, took him under his wing, providing refuge and support. It was here
                        that
                        Motoki encountered Kiyoko, the current heir to the position of Defense Governor.

                    <p>
                        Motoki vowed to hone his architectural skills, aspiring to meet and exceed his father's
                        expectations. This determination propelled him to carve his own path, eventually assuming a
                        prominent position as an architect, striving to surpass his father's legacy and achieve even
                        greater heights.

                        Norvyn is a descendant of a long line of a noble family, but due to some issues, Norvyn left
                        at
                        a young age to go to the portal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he first came through the portal, the land was still full and rich of resources, so he
                        started a mining company close to a small village, and as a result, he gained a lot of money
                        selling resources. But when the portal broke, in order to survive, he sold the company off
                        and
                        moved from village to village, hoping to find a place to live.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He spent years trying just to survive until one day he stumbled upon Valdelor. When he did,
                        he
                        had little to no money, but despite that, he started a small orchard, and over the years, it
                        grew and grew into a large company. As a result, he had more money than what to do with, so
                        he
                        helped the community in any way he could. Due to his success, people have tried to sabotage
                        him
                        but failed. Due to his paranoia, he lives in a house in the countryside but still runs the
                        orchard and is looking to expand to other kingdoms besides Valdelor.

                        Ocioriss was born a Zurtu as his father and mother were both from there. He's a familiar
                        face to
                        the folk even though he spends most of his time inside his lab. Ocioriss has been fascinated
                        by
                        The Greater Alchemist ever since his mother told him a story about the best alchemist. He
                        used
                        to use his father's wine barrels to make potions and elixirs until he ruined his father's
                        new
                        wine that was supposed to help the family during rough times. Ocioriss stopped practising
                        alchemy for a while because he loved his family more than alchemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ocioriss' father lost his life fighting a group of thieves that stole a bunch of his wine.
                        Ocioriss had to take care of his mother, he tried his best but he just couldn't keep up with
                        maintaining the wine shop and taking care of his sick mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When his mother died, Ocioriss locked himself up, he kept his parents'corpses hoping to one
                        day
                        find the elixir of resurrection. During his experiments he brewed many potions and sold them
                        to
                        doctors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He caught the attention of an old pupil of the Greater Alchemist and became his pupil
                        shortly
                        after. Ocioriss passed the base alchemy tests and was granted permission to read the
                        Alchenomicon; a book containing all potion recipes, rituals and symbols of alchemy. Ocioriss
                        used the book to experiment on his dead parents, when his teacher found out he was banned
                        from
                        the Alchemists large lab. Ocioriss stole the original Alchenomicon and rewrote the whole
                        book
                        hundreds of times to the point he didn't need the book anymore. He still kept it in case
                        something slipped his mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ocioriss now lives among the Zurtus hiding his secret. He's very kind to people and also
                        still
                        passionate about alchemy. But he's also very shady when it comes to his researches and lab.

                        childhood
                        and was intrested about books and history. When Perard was 23 he went to a monastery and
                        became
                        a monk.

                    <p>
                        He lived there many years and became wiser and stronger. But then, one dark night the undead
                        attacked to the monastery and destroyed it. Perard managed to escape with few other monks.
                        Now

                        He was born in the capital during Shuri's last chaotic years and lived through constant
                        fear. He
                        started working at the age of 7 in the farms with his father under his landlords to support
                        his
                        family. He would hear screams whenever he went and witnessed people massacre each other in
                        battles while hiding and running.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 14, his mother became ill and as they couldn't afford the medicine, the
                        landlords
                        offered us to fight in their name for the extra money. Those were the very last years of the
                        war, they were the most terrible and the bloodshed was everywhere. The battle never ended
                        and
                        many died including the father while protecting Sagishi from an arrow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He spent those 3 years murdering, hiding, assassinating, and betraying for him to go home at
                        last to only find that his mother died from disease and his landlords were killed along with
                        a
                        kamikaze attack. Not knowing what to do, he decided to find his purpose along with his new
                        friends in Shuri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He possesses strength and resilience, capable of tackling tough and lengthy tasks, yet
                        sometimes
                        susceptible to being pushed around. His overall skills are decent, though he carries
                        lingering
                        nostalgia and trauma from wartime experiences. He keeps his skills hidden due to past
                        betrayals.

                    <p>
                        Soya’s father was a renowned alchemist, making and selling potions to the public and when
                        Soya
                        was 8 and his older brother Atai was 10 his father decided to teach them alchemy and then
                        afterwards they would sell this to the public but Soya wasn't interested in alchemy. All he
                        wanted to do was sell. His brother was different, he studied long and hard whilst Soya
                        hindered
                        his older brother. His father always told him “If a young boy wants to go up in the world,
                        then
                        he's got to learn the tricks of the trade” Soyar didn't understand at first seeing he was
                        only
                        9. But later it began to hit Soyar, after the (alchemy course and when Soyar was 10) to
                        trade
                        you have to learn to trick. Of course this wasn’t what his father meant. His brother Atai
                        went
                        to learn how to become a master builder elsewhere whilst Soya started to trade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the measly age of 11 Soya sold his first faulty item. He didn't charge much, nore would
                        it do
                        any harm but he loved the sense of power and accomplishment. Soya left home at 16 and went
                        travelling with two Llamas and spent the rest of his days as a fake merchant selling his
                        faulty
                        goods across the lands. His father's words were always ringing in his head ‘trick of the
                        trade’
                        and so that's what he did. Soya spent days either picking flowers, filling bottles of water,
                        plucking hairs of animals or taking the feces. But that's not what he sold. Using the power
                        of
                        false advertising and scamming Soya created Dragon Scales (a dead horses hooves) “plucked
                        right
                        of the back of him I tell ya” and also Strength Beads (small wooden balls) “when one wields
                        the
                        bead of strength he immediately becomes empowered by the gods above!” then there is the
                        Snake
                        Tooth (a sharpened baby tooth) “it cures anything keeping you down”. You get the idea. Then
                        by
                        the time the victims find out they have been tricked, Soya is out of town. Until he returns
                        to
                        sell some more garbage. During the wars Soya began to see opportunity. During his days of
                        learning alchemy he did learn something. With the measly amount of knowledge he had he began
                        making medicine, but Soya wasn’t being a hero, he cut corners, taking out ingredients that
                        are
                        hard to get.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As long as it was aesthetically convincing it would do. His items were so convincing that he
                        began to use them himself. Knocking himself out multiple times. Selling multiple of his fake
                        medicines to the people injured from war and on the black market. When Soya turned 19 he
                        gave
                        one of his drugs to a guy in a passing forest between towns. Knocking him unconscious on the
                        floor. He looked at the man, a young adult not much older than him, it was his brother. He
                        ran,
                        as far as he could he was afraid of what he had become but his inner devil didn't want him
                        to
                        stop. Soya loved two things: trade and money so he went back to his younger self. He decided
                        never to let his products cause harm to the customer. Only financially. Soya came to Shuri,
                        his
                        hometown to find his brother and apologize.Soya is a con artist and the best con artist
                        anyone
                        has ever seen.

                        His backstory is also not known that well by the non-Zurtu but is believed to be quite a
                        special
                        case, especially for him to become a king at such a young age. It's also believed that there

                        most likely share his life story with you as a symbol of deep trust and connection.

                        Tea was born and raised by his foreign parents. They were nomad travelers, who knew little
                        english. They decided to name him after the resource they sought most, the reason they were
                        traveling from country to country-- tea. His mother and father died by suffocation when they
                        tried searching through buried treasure.

                        He's a rather tall, but not huge, well built man with a tanned dark-ish skin complexion, he
                        tends to cut his hair leaving only his bushy beard, his eyes shine an emerald green.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His past is complex. Now he tries to become what his ancestors were to the old Zurtu. His
                        history is known only to those he sees as friends and family. The past he lived scarred him,
                        and
                        upon those scars he built a new name for himself. Now he just wants to see his people
                        flourish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His life of labour made him a strong and tough man, though that same life scarred him
                        emotionally, now he can't connect with people quite like other Zurtu, though he still holds
                        many
                        others dear. He’s extremely allergic to gluten.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He’s an exceptional stonecutter and mason and his steak is said to rival that of royal
                        cooks.
                        He’s decent at long distance running and competitive eating.

                        Thomas is and has always been very emotional, acting based on feelings and not logic,
                        usually
                        regretting the things he has done in anger. He has also always been extremely curious. He
                        does
                        try to act like a royal person in order to not make people angry, but it does not work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thomas was born as the second child to Thomas le Fey II and his wife, Lillie Àlcasara. They
                        were
                        really nice to Thomas and his four siblings. Because the eldest child, Perard, didn't want
                        to be
                        the lord, Thomas, as the second child, was chosen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thomas's strengths include a wide range of emotions such as anger, happiness, and sadness,
                        as
                        well as maintaining friendships, particularly with Perard. However, he struggles with
                        fighting,
                        constructing large houses, avoiding conflicts, and has a fear of spiders. Notably, he
                        possesses
                        the skill of consuming a slice of cake in under a second and walking backwards.
