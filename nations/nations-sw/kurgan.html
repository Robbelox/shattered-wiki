            History
        </h1>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúThe barbaric tribes of the north were the ones who benefited most from this breakdown of the natural order. They conducted raid after raid into the new broken lands, taking gold, food and slaves back to their homelands in triumph. For a while the barbarian tribes grew into vastly wealthy kingdoms, until their hubris got the better of them.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout history, the Kurgans have been seen as barbaric and uncultured, that they'd rather take life than give it and that they would start wars with the early winter snow. That is mostly untrue. The people of the north have always had to fight to survive, by nature they have fought to eat and live.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have battled endlessly with the nations that surround them, The Prythonic people to the east, the Tiberians to the south and the Achaean to the west.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the shattering the nations that surrounded them rose in wealth, but eventually became ill with a horrific plague, the Nasyrik Epidemic. The Kurgan people tried their best to avoid it, but eventually contracted it. Their hubris got the better of them. Thinking they could profit off others' downfall, they spend more time raiding and gathering riches. What they brought back to their lands instead, was the disease itself. It hung to the gold and slaves like hair to skin, and infected many of the men, women and children. The Shaman of the time vowed that the gods had forsaken them and that they were left to fend for themselves to redeem their favor with their god.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Jarl of the time, Haraldr of Uthon, defied the word of the King of the time and brought many men and women to join him to new lands. Haraldr knew that the plague would ruin the land and the king with it. He left to spread further north where he would rebuild the Kurgan Kingdom. He led his followers to icy lands and pine forests. Along the way they found a forest made of pure ice which he knew that many people wouldn‚Äôt be able to attack, it was the perfect defense for their new land.

            Customs
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Battle
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are many individual rituals a warrior might enact before battle, but some of the more widely performed and seen are the ones acted by the shaman, the Jarl or King.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jarl will slice a mark into the dominant arm of the man or woman at the head of the march. This is to mark strength and higher rank, but also to test the warrior in battle to see if they can withstand a handicap in battle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The couple that stands at the front of the raid must also cut each other, wherever they like, and then lick the others cut, making them connected in life, and possibly into death. But also, that if they are split up in the battle, they are still together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before a raid, each family would have to paint each other with runes with the blood of their totem animal. (every family has their own totem animal which they must hunt at least twice each year.) They then dip the blade of their weapons in what remains. The family must collect the blood over a year, and keep it protected, or see that the gods will give you bad luck in the fight ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some berserkers live out in the woods a week before a raid to encapsulate their family totem animal. This puts them in an hypnotic, animalistic state that allows them to go into a frenzy during battle. Sometimes wearing nothing but animal furs and heads, they go to war, using their bare hands and teeth to fight instead of weapons and shields. According to legends, they also feel no pain and keep fighting despite being badly injured.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Marriage
        </h2>
        <p>
            Marriage is an important event in society, and as such, marks the coming together of two families, those of any two people. The idea of sexual preferences is unknown to the Kurgan people and they believe the gods created them all equal. Men are allowed to wed men, and women to women. Both families observe a certain set of customs in order to ensure a socially acceptable marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest step is that one is accompanied by members of his family to the other‚Äôs family to propose. If the proposal is accepted, a date is set and other details are discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the set date, a huge feast takes place which is attended by the families of the two as well as other guests. The feast continues for at least three days and then they pronounce vows of fidelity to each other. It's also a custom for witnesses to accompany the couple to their bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The higher you sit in society, the more marriage partners you are able to have. Some Jarls will sometimes have upwards of three. Within the Kurgan community it shows power and strength to have more than one lover.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Execution
        </h2>
        <p>
            The blood eagle consisted of the victim being placed facedown and restrained. An eagle is carved into his back, and then the ribs are severed from the spine with an axe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ribs and the skin around them are pulled outward to represent the wings of the eagle. Next, salt is rubbed into the wound. (The victim is still alive at this point.) Then the lungs are pulled out of the body and stretched across the ribs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the victim dies, the lungs are fluttering in the wind, reminiscent of a bird‚Äôs wings.
