                The War
            </h1>
            <p>Roughly two hundred years prior to the first Shattering, the Ender invaded the Nether, attempting to terraform the dimension and wipe out the scattered clans of Piglins. For many years, the Piglins were decimated, before eventually uniting under a singular clan. This clan's leader won several key battles, and in time the united front of the Piglins drove out the invaders.</p>
        
            <h1>The Aftermath</h1>
            <p>The hero of the war was made king of the newly united Piglins across the Nether. However, he was only suited to wartime, and his kingdom fell to revolt and civil war not two decades after being founded. After being imprisoned by the enraged population, he was set to a public execution. However, he went missing from his cell not long before it was scheduled, and was not heard from again. The Bastions created for the war fell into disrepair, now only inhabited by those who dare stake a claim over the buildings. Many Piglins dare not try, considering the old war bases cursed. Warped Forests are a result of Ender terraforming, a hybridization of chorus and crimson.</p>
