                    <p>Abelio is a Kurgan. He wears a mask after an incident involving 2 arrows to his eyes. Without
                        his
                        mask, he is practically blind unless in a darkened room. If he goes outside without his mask

                        The
                        sunlight makes his eyes hurt and pains him. You will never see him outside without it.

                        She was raised by a Prythonian archer named Briana, who unfortunately died after the
                        Shattering,
                        when Acionna was still fairly young and immature. She had once wanted to become a Druid, but
                        decided she would not try to become one after her mother died. Acionna decided she would
                        find
                        her own, unique place in the new world and society they lived in, and wanted to be as
                        independent as possible. She is always ready to help in any way that will benefit the
                        kingdom
                        and its people. Now a diplomat.

                    <p>
                        She's cheerful, friendly, likes animals, fast, and always up for a challenge but she’s also
                        prone to getting lost... a lot, which has caused her to always carry a compass. She is also
                        prone to collecting as many flowers as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is intelligent and an excellent orator/speaker, and thinks on her feet. She’s good at
                        talking people down when they’re angry or frustrated, and people often perceive her as
                        friendly
                        even when she might not be. She makes excellent wine.

                        Abandoned by his parents, Ada was raised near the ocean alongside many turtles. He lived up

                        age 9 through the turtles' ways and munching on kelp and seaweed. Eventually, he made his

                        life enough to survive and be taken in by Bastaernia, where he found himself a lovely
                        Achaean
                        wife. His most important goal is to be the most experienced man in the world.

                        and
                        finally reconnaissance; he loves gathering materials and going undercover to seek what would

                    <p>
                        Æthelstan was born to a small farming family in the Bastærni lands. Throughout the ages, his
                        family had attended to this small farming estate, tending to crops, trading those crops to
                        whoever controlled the land at the time (which changed frequently), and becoming victims to
                        several raids from rival tribes (which happened even more frequently). Despite this, he
                        seemed
                        to have a tongue of silver and could talk his way out of most situations. Many times he was
                        a
                        mediator between the tribes, settling uneasy peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a while, Æthelstan had aspirations like most low-born boys his age: to become a knight,
                        fight great battles, and earn glory and gold. His uncle Alfrid had done the same when he was
                        but
                        a baby, and when he visited his brother Æthelstead, he told the best stories. Later,
                        Æthelstan
                        grew out of his aspirations of becoming a knight when his father's health began to wane;
                        he'd
                        take his father's position for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Shattering hit hard. His father, whose health was already failing, became a victim to
                        one of
                        the great plagues. His mother was bedridden for weeks on end, and no matter how hard
                        Æthelstan
                        tried to care for her, she only got worse. Then young Æthelstan contracted it too, and he
                        thought that he too would perish in the midst of this plague. He pushed through and came out
                        on
                        the other side with interesting news. In all the chaos, some local Bastærni tribes united to
                        form the kingdom of Osterwalde. Æthelstan pledged his allegiance to the reigning monarch and
                        began the task of rebuilding his once great estate, realizing that most other farms had been
                        destroyed.

                    <p>
                        Auduin Wynthoff was on the younger side when the Shattering hit, and he forgets much of his
                        time
                        before the Shattering. However, he survived because of his father, Askeladd Wynthoff.
                        Askeladd
                        was leading the Waldelach tribe when the Shattering was just starting, noticing disease,
                        famine,
                        and dangers in other tribes. He decided to lead his tribe off the grid. This kept Auduin and
                        the
                        rest of the tribe isolated from the plagues, and they tilled land and set up fruitful farms
                        to
                        prevent famine. The Waldelach tribe was doing very well living in isolation, and Auduin's
                        mother
                        was even pregnant with a boy. His mother, Ylva, was very healthy and had a safe and fruitful
                        birth, welcoming Auduin's younger brother, Thorkfihn, into the family. The birth of
                        Thorkfihn
                        gave Auduin a new purpose; he wanted Thorkfihn to have a regular life. After a few years,
                        Askeladd taught both of his sons how to hunt, build, lead, and trust others. Meanwhile, Ylva
                        taught the two boys generosity, love, and respect, maturing Auduin and Thorkfihn into fine
                        young
                        men.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, on a cold fall morning, Ylva saw a wandering man who looked very lost. She went
                        straight for Askeladd and the boys, asking them to see the man and help him if he needed
                        anything. Thorkfihn ran up straight to the man with Godspeed and asked the man for his name
                        and
                        if he needed anything. Thorkfihn was not greeted with a name or request but a forceful blow
                        to
                        his head with a baton. He was unconscious. The man picked him up and ran away, never to be
                        seen
                        again by the Waldelach tribe. This tragedy was the first of many to come upon the Waldelach.
                        Almost right after Thorkfihn’s kidnapping, disease killed half of the Waldelach tribe.
                        Depressingly, Ylva fell ill and was getting worse every day. One day, she had called Auduin
                        over
                        and left him with these words: “Spread peace, protect Askeladd and the Waldelach. And please
                        son, find Thorkfihn.” Auduin swore by these words. He then watched Ylva die in Askeladd’s
                        arms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Askeladd was suffering from severe PTSD before Ylva fell ill, and this was only increased by
                        her
                        death. Askeladd did his best to guide the Waldelach to success, but he was starting to fail
                        and
                        become resented by the people due to his lust for finding his son. Realizing this, Askeladd
                        decided to give leadership of the Waldelach to Auduin. Auduin accepted by swearing he’d
                        refuse
                        to let another Waldelach die and promised everyone a fruitful life like the old ways they
                        knew
                        before his time. The people accepted Auduin as their leader because of this promise. It was
                        not
                        long after Auduin’s gaining of leadership that his father, too, fell ill. Askeladd knew he
                        was
                        bound for death and prayed for salvation beyond death. Shortly after saying his prayer, he
                        told
                        Auduin that he was going to end his own life to be with Ylva in the forest of the afterlife.
                        Auduin didn’t want to lose his father; he couldn’t let him kill himself. However, it was out
                        of
                        his control, as Askeladd said “lead well, serve your tribe. I love you son,” he took his
                        sword
                        and sliced his body and gut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Auduin struggled to bury his father and almost fell to depression. But then he heard word
                        from a
                        hunter who had reportedly seen a larger settlement thriving far, far in the distance. Auduin
                        now
                        remembered the words of his father and mother, to love others and care for the tribe. Auduin
                        told the Waldelach tribe to pack up their houses onto their horses, as they were going to be
                        marching for salvation. Thus began Waldelach’s 3-month-long trek to a large settlement of
                        over
                        10 different tribes. Along the path, Auduin prayed to his gods many times, to see his
                        brother
                        again, for the betterment of his people, and for his parents who had passed. It was after a
                        very
                        long and thoughtful prayer for salvation that he spotted the settlement and hastily arrived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the Waldelach arrived in “Osterwalde,” they were met with cold stares and very few open
                        arms. Many people had tainted trusts and closed hearts due to the losses caused by the
                        Shattering. Seeing this, Auduin made another promise, this time stepping onto a small hill
                        and
                        nearly screaming at the top of his lungs: “I will open all of your hearts, peace and power
                        will
                        be restored. Let me, Auduin, be your salvation.” Few people took Auduin seriously at the
                        time,
                        but he worked to fulfill his promise every day by teaching farming, hunting, and building to
                        everyone he met. He also helped anyone who was in need, even if it was beyond Auduin’s
                        abilities
                        to help; he’d do the best he could. And over time, the people started to recognize Auduin as
                        someone to rely on for leadership and assistance. This grew and grew until one day when
                        Auduin
                        left his house, there was a crowd of people asking him to be their king and lead them to
                        peace
                        and power. Auduin was still half asleep, but he accepted with grace and went on to thank
                        every
                        citizen. And thus, uniting the tribes once again, Auduin became King Auduin of Osterwalde.
                        However, Auduin still yearns to find his brother one day, dead or alive; he just wishes to
                        know.

                        Arne grew up in a rural area with his mother and father and 3 brothers. His dad was a
                        hunter/fighter, which led to his death when Arne was 11. His dad thought them basic things
                        like
                        how to shoot a bow, use a sword, ride a horse etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arne is not much of an architect but is good with his hands. He worked on a small farm for a
                        number of years and was then hired in a mine full-time so he could pay family rent. Their
                        only
                        food was wheat, potatoes, carrots and beef (from the few
                        cows they owned).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day in the middle of the night an unknown group of armoured men came to
                        their house posing as the land owner and that they wanted rent. Arne explained that he just
                        payed the rent and cant afford to pay it again, so the men killed their cows and burned
                        their
                        crops and house killing the youngest brother. They fled when the other villagers came to
                        help
                        the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the morning arne started to look for a new settlement. They tried to travel far
                        away north to hide from the unknown men. After many weeks of searching, his 2 remaining
                        brothers
                        died of hunger and flu. Eventually Arne reached snow. They had infinite water by melting the
                        snow and they were happy. But when they went to sleep, the fire burned out faster than
                        expected
                        and Arne's
                        mother froze to death. Arne was scared and heartbroken so he ran as far and as fast as he
                        could.
                        The next night while looking for a settlement, a pack of wolves spotted Arne so he ran and
                        hid
                        in a cave. He woke up fine the next morning to a group of men, armoured, but not like the
                        "unknown men". They helped him up and brought him out of the cave. He turned around to see a
                        settlement known as Kurgan.

                    <p>
                        Artemios grew up in a small, secluded island north of Achaea. She lived in a small village
                        with
                        her family: her father, mother, and some farm animals. Her favorite memory back on the
                        island
                        was when she had gone fishing with her father at the age of 7. She remembers how beautiful
                        it
                        looked as they left just as the sun went down. Her father was trying to teach her to fish,
                        but
                        Artemios had other ideas, like watching the fish and begging her dad to let them go. As they
                        ventured out into the sea looking for an area with a lot of fish, Artemios stared down at
                        the
                        colorful ocean, with various fishes and turtles passing by. The young girl giggled at the
                        sight
                        of a new creature. It was one she hadn't seen before, a grey animal that made a cute noise.
                        As
                        it got closer, she gasped as she got the Dolphin's Grace effect. It made a cute noise and
                        pushed
                        the boat faster. "Daddy! Look!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that day, Artemios became fond of dolphins. She admired them deeply. She grew up
                        happily
                        until the age of 15. Her parents were growing older, and they didn't want Artemios to live
                        her
                        life stuck on the boring island. They sent her away, hoping to give her a great life and the
                        possibility of new wealth. They didn't have the money to come along on the journey. They
                        gathered supplies for months for her to travel somewhere, and while she boated all the way
                        to
                        the place she would find out to be Achaea, she had turned 16.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artemios lives a happy life in Achaea with her new husband and tends to her ranch. She does
                        not
                        have a job but considers herself a happy baker and archer. After the loss of her dogs Coco
                        and
                        Puppy, she is very caring towards her animals and respects them deeply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She wishes to become a famous archer, known for her perfect aim and her determination in
                        battle.
                        She also wishes to bring back riches to her family to give them a happy life for the rest of
                        their days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her skills are in baking, farming, archery, and building. She is named after the Greek
                        goddess
                        Artemis, so she was raised as an archer. Artemios is also fond of sweets like chocolate cake
                        and
                        raspberry pie as her mom would cook her those when she was upset or after she had come back
                        from
                        tasks with her father.

                    <p>
                        Artemios's sword combat is not the greatest since she never had the ability to actually
                        train it
                        during her time on her family's island. She is also super clumsy, known for casually falling
                        off
                        mountains and stepping on the exact wrong block and managing to fall to her death in lava...
                        I
                        mean, what?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has a weird liking for the color silver. She thinks it represents herself well due to
                        being
                        named after Artemis. Artemios also loves dolphins and cats, despite having multiple dogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She dislikes most breakfast items, like toast and eggs. Artemios also cannot stand the color
                        pink. Along with that, she thinks jungle wood looks awful. Like... it looks awful.

                        Astrid has no memory of her family, and her memories of her childhood are rather hazy. Found
                        and
                        raised in a convent from 10 to 17 years old, it was a strict and very quiet environment. She
                        endured being locked in small rooms and regularly beaten by a bitter priest in order to
                        'straighten her up.' Despite the harshness, she found solace in caring for the convent,
                        particularly tending to the garden when the priest was in a good mood. Obsessed with design,
                        the
                        priest noticed her talent and allowed her to explore architecture, surprised by her skill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sent to work with an experienced builder, she stayed until the shattering happened. Escaping
                        to
                        Ormsa, she followed Haradlr and his group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Astrid possesses strengths in creative ability, beauty, good planning strategies, and
                        calmness.
                        However, she is not well trained in combat, lacks physical strength, and frequently
                        struggles
                        with sleeping. Despite being timid and shy, she makes concerted efforts to communicate
                        effectively.

                    <p>
                        Fun Fact: Astrid’s hair turned stark white on her 18th birthday for an unknown reason,
                        eventually fading to a light blonde.

                    <p>
                        Hailing from the prestigious cadet dynasty of the illustrious Tiberians, the Varians are
                        known
                        as one of the most powerful families in the old Empire. Ruling from the city of Vara, they
                        have
                        considerable influence within all branches of government, especially within political and
                        military affairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aurelius was born as a second son to the head of the Varian line, Septimus Vara. Known as a
                        cruel man whose ambitions knew no bounds, and even some rumoured plans to lead a coup
                        against
                        the current Emperor to usurp the throne. As a second son, Aurelius was always treated as a
                        ‘spare’ rather than the ‘heir’. He hardly ever saw his parents, who devoted much of their
                        free
                        time to the eldest son, leaving Aurelius with the servants. Aurelius developed a hatred for
                        his
                        family, and often took to sneaking away from the palace at night, spending the nights in the
                        poor districts of Vara with a gang of children his age, taking part in petty theft and
                        mischief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he was discovered sneaking out at night by his father, he was banished from the city
                        and
                        sent to an academy on the mountainous northern border. It was clear the direction his life
                        would
                        take, as devised by his father. A life in the military, bolstering the Varian line by
                        bringing
                        glory to the house, as well as influence within the army, all to improve his brother’s
                        position.
                        The academy treated their students harshly in a militaristic fashion, making the developing
                        boys
                        wake before dawn, study for hours each day, and finish daunting chores. Living in the
                        desolate
                        mountain side was extremely tough, with extremely cold winters, little food, and
                        backbreaking
                        work. Many students couldn’t cope with the new way of life, and by the end of the first
                        season,
                        only half of the year remained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the hardships he faced, Aurelius continued to survive the work, pushed forwards by
                        his
                        intense hatred of his family and determined to prove them wrong. He excelled under the
                        circumstances, gaining top marks in both classroom academics and physical classes, quickly
                        mastering horse riding and duelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he reached his name day, becoming a man, he was granted leave to travel to Vara, and
                        choose
                        a deity for himself, to watch over and grant him strength. For Aurelius, there was only one
                        choice. He scaled the high staircase leading to the most glorious temple in the city,
                        passing
                        the crippled priests of the goddess, and kneeled down before her altar. He chose the Goddess
                        of
                        War, Beluna as his patron saint, devoting himself to her worship until the end of his days.
                        To
                        seal the pact, he pulled out a knife and marked his face, causing long streams of blood to
                        flow
                        down past his eyes. Despite the intense pain, he did not flinch, the goddess’ power giving
                        him
                        the strength to push past any discomfort. When he rose, he was a different person to before.
                        Now
                        he was a man, with a new aura of strength. With the goddess’ blessing, his destiny had been
                        altered forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few nights later, Aurelius was awoken by the world suddenly shaking. He jumped out of bed,
                        running to the window, just to see the world moving from side to side from some unknown
                        reason.
                        As the shaking grew more violent, screams started to be heard through the darkness, and
                        buildings started to fall, their foundation broken. He ran from the academy along with a few
                        other younger boys, and they hid in the woods, surviving only off of things they could find
                        or
                        catch. However, he knew this couldn’t last. Some day they would have to return. And so, a
                        month
                        later, they ventured out into the world again. When he reached the nearest town, it was
                        empty of
                        life. Only ruins remained of what had once been a prosperous town. It was the same with
                        every
                        town they came across, with only gangs of bandits appearing out of the shadows to loot
                        anything
                        of value from the survivors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he finally returned to his home city of Vara, it was no different. Not even one of the
                        greatest cities on the continent could withstand the natural disasters that plagued the
                        empire.
                        It was a shadow of what it once was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally turning his back to the lands of the past, he returned to the mountains, collecting
                        survivors along the way. The land was harsh, and survival hard, but they managed to
                        continue.
                        His leadership saved the lives of many, and he was soon elected as king of what remained of
                        the
                        Varian people. Thankfully, due to its isolation, they escaped the worst of the resulting
                        pandemic that plagued the lands over the next few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now he returns from the highlands, bringing with him the toughest people of the greatest
                        culture
                        known to man. Will he establish an Empire to rival the Tiberians? Or will he fall to some
                        foreign invader like so many have? Only time will tell.

                        As a young boy, Cedric fought to survive. His father was a warrior, and so he was taken into
                        the
                        warbands as a child, despite the harsh life. He lost his father young, but fortunately he
                        was
                        well liked, and the men kept him around, feeding him scraps. The lack of food, the cold
                        weather,
                        the long distances to march, they all added up on the growing boy’s development. He would
                        either
                        grow up weak, or stronger than ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 16, he finally underwent the warrior’s rites, becoming a man in the eyes of
                        the
                        Galatai. He was finally able to take part in a raid himself, and to win glory and wealth.
                        They
                        were planning to attack an isolated Kurgan village in the borderlands between the two
                        nations,
                        an easy raid that would slowly bring him into the society. Or so they thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They attacked at night, their longbows drawn as they edged closer to the town, hiding behind
                        trees and avoiding the lights. Then came the screams. Men disappeared into the darkness,
                        their
                        lives suddenly extinguished. It had been a trap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The raid leader had been one of the first to die, an axe flung expertly into his skull,
                        killing
                        him instantly. The raid fell into disarray. There was no longer a leader, and they started
                        panicking, firing arrows blindly into the treeline in the hopes of landing a lucky shot, but
                        instead only bringing on another onslaught of Kurgan. They were surrounded. Cedric had to
                        make a
                        choice; surrender, or fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He raised his voice, before shouting at the top of his lungs, ordering the men to form a
                        skein
                        formation, and to advance deeper into the woods, to force their way through the Kurgan
                        lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warband lost half their men, including their leader, but escaped total defeat. In
                        recognition of his efforts, he was unanimously elected as the next leader of the warband.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Word spread of his deeds, as he led the warband to victory after victory, bringing back
                        plunder,
                        slaves, and most importantly, prestige. When the Shattering came, people followed him. He
                        managed to save many people from the onslaught of sicknesses that plagued Prythonia by
                        leading
                        them into the snowy wastelands, his years of experience allowing them to survive in the
                        desolate
                        place. When he emerged, he was not a leader, but a King. The new, and only king of
                        Prythonia.

                    <p>
                        Conan was born into the poor side of a very wealthy city. He was taught at a very young age
                        not to oppose the rich. He disagreed with this rule. When at the age of 17, Conan found some
                        likeminded individuals who called themselves "liberators", and they wanted to bring balance
                        to
                        the city's economic climate. "In this way, none will be rich or poor", they said. Conan was
                        skeptical, but also eager to leave his certain life of poverty and servitude. So, he threw
                        away
                        all signs of his past and said, "Show me how.".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These "liberators" would eventually turn out to be a group of terrorists with the intent to
                        overthrow the city's government. These terrorists were primarily made up of orphans and
                        people
                        of severe poverty, though the driving force behind them were the betrayed soldiers from the
                        city's forgotten regimes. Soldiers that outlived their usefulness and were deemed unfit for
                        duty
                        after receiving too many injuries or becoming too old. Conan was amongst the poor, and so he
                        resented the city's hierarchy, thus allying himself with these rebels. But he was only one
                        of
                        many, as he and the other followers beside him learned how to fight without fighting, how to
                        strike from the shadows and avoid all conflict; to kill unseen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the ages of 17 to 22, he honed these skills as an assassin and alchemist, learning all
                        sorts of things about how one man could take on an entire patrol of well-armed knights. He
                        was
                        one of the few to survive and be deemed a master. Before he could really turn these skills
                        toward the hierarchy, the Shattering came and destroyed everything. The hierarchy was
                        destroyed,
                        but so too were Conan's friends... his family. He was the sole survivor of the chaos.
                        Whoever managed to escape the city's ruin would be killed in the aftermath. Conan, however,
                        survived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He bided his time, not knowing how many years had passed while surviving in the wilderness
                        to
                        the north. He had never been in any kind of forestation before but was told what to expect
                        by
                        his terrorist brethren. Using his skills as an assassin and alchemist, he survived by
                        gathering
                        any food, materials and reagents he could find. He learned never to build a home or try to
                        find
                        shelter, since it would merely trap you beneath the feet of a hoard of monsters and insane
                        barbarians. He learned to hunt during the day and hide up in the trees at night. He learned
                        to
                        survive alone, without assistance from his fellow assassins and alchemists. He learned the
                        price
                        and the benefits of solitude and anti-socialism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, here he was, years later and still in the northern forests, surviving. Nothing changed
                        until the day a scouting party of Prythonians set upon him. He easily hid from their sight,
                        having seen them from far away. He was nearly ready to kill them all based on shear instinct
                        when he suddenly awoke from his barbaric post-apocalyptic slumber and realized, “These are
                        real
                        people!” he thought to himself. So, he quickly got a look at their clothing and made the
                        summation that they were some form of nation, due to the markings and symbols on their
                        equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan managed to follow them for a few minutes, and as luck would have it, one of their
                        members called for a halt. “Let me have another look at the map for a moment.” their leader
                        said. Conan capitalized on this event and moved in. As they stared at their leader in front
                        of them, dismounting and taking a rest from riding their horses, Conan managed to steal a
                        Prythonian flag from one of the horses’ side-pouches. He then backed away, hiding behind
                        some
                        brush while he worked to make the flag look dingy and torn. He tore it in small, believable
                        ways. He rubbed it against the ground in a rough scraping pattern. The flag began to look
                        almost
                        as dingy as Conan did, after all those years hiding in the northern forests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as the scouting party was to resume their travels, Conan came out in front of them from
                        a nearby bush, holding the flag over his shoulder. In the condition he was in after all
                        these
                        years in the forest, his clothing was unrecognizable, looking more like pieces of dirty wool
                        or
                        parchment. The Prythonian’s first aimed their bows before seeing the flag strung over his
                        shoulder, easily blending with his torn and battered attire. They quickly lowered their
                        weapons
                        and questioned him. As an assassin, Conan found it very easy to utilize practiced universal
                        lies. All he had to do was exchange a few words here and there that gave specific
                        info-textrmation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan spun a tale about how he had lost his way a couple of weeks ago. He claimed to be a
                        Prythonian and was captured by some barbarians but escaped. As a trained assassin, part of
                        his
                        skillset was learning to practice rehearsed universal lies. Lies that apply to multiple
                        situations and can be used anywhere, if a few select words are exchanged to fit the
                        situation at
                        hand. Using these skills, Conan managed to fool the scouting party and they gladly took him
                        back with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan was finally out of the wilderness and into civilization once more. He was still very
                        unused to speaking to people after all this time, but he had been practicing keeping his
                        social
                        skills for a day just like this. At first, he made an awkward integration into Prythonia,
                        but he
                        managed to fit in after some weeks passed. It was difficult to keep lying, since nobody
                        recognized him, and he had to keep pretending that he was “forgetting” all their customs and
                        daily rituals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually though, he was found out by the King of Prythonia himself, Cedric. This king
                        apparently knew all his subjects, and Conan was not one of them. The moment he looked upon
                        Conan, he knew something was wrong. Conan, not even getting a moment to say anything,
                        was suddenly set-upon by Cedric’s warriors. Conan quickly became ready to fight, but just
                        before the conflict began, the barbarians Conan had become accustomed to fighting suddenly
                        emerged, attacking from all sides in the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan managed to prove himself in battle. He fought differently than the Prythonians do. He
                        fought in ways that were cunning and efficient. He evaded most direct conflict and sought
                        out
                        ways to assist his allies. He quickly became a boon in the battle, wielding his Emerald Axe
                        and
                        the occasional potion, he turned the tide of battle and saved many lives that day. The King
                        Cedric look upon Conan a second time, and did not see a Prythonian, but an ally,
                        nonetheless.

                        each
                        side, just above where a normal humans ears would be. Unlike normal piglins, Ebbe's skull
                        isn't
                        as wide, and his eye sockets aren't as round. This is due to only being half piglin, and
                        being
                        what Ebbe had dubbed a "Pig-Man." His skin is a light brown, similar to the colour of dried
                        dirt. Physically, Ebbe is 96 years old, which is considered early middle aged or late young
                        adult for piglins. Ebbe also has two tusks coming from the sides of his mouth at an angle.
                        Each
                        are 6 ¼ centimetres long.</p>
                    <h1>Story</h1>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not much is publicly known about Ebbe's history, but it is known he was once a great warrior
                        and
                        leader of the piglins in a large conflict, but fled after the war. After appearing in the
                        Overworld roughly 75 years before The Shattering first begun, he could not survive in the
                        foreign realm. He wandered about the world aimlessly, avoiding towns when possible to avoid
                        conflict, slowly picking up different skills, such as foraging, hunting, reading, writing,
                        speaking, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the Shattering hit, Ebbe was forced to constantly be on the move. The world, now broken
                        and
                        riddled with monsters just like him, there were now people who would actively seek to hunt
                        them
                        down and kill them. Even if Ebbe tried to speak and plea with one of the humans, it only
                        made
                        them see Ebbe as a bigger monster in their eyes. It was not until early 2020 Ebbe met
                        Haraldr of
                        Uthon and Einar. These two proved to be great friends to Ebbe, as it was them who made Ebbe
                        feel
                        accepted for the first time in over a century. It would be these three who created the
                        Kurgan
                        mining town of Braka Hellir, and Einar and Ebbe would go on to become the owners of the
                        town.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Ebbe's Undead Journey
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When Ebbe first arrived in the Overworld, much of his flesh rotted away, as well as his
                        right
                        eye. Normally, when this happens to a piglin, they lose all sense of individuality as their
                        minds rot away with the flesh. However, this did not happen to Ebbe, and his consciousness
                        remained intact after death. For years, Ebbe simply accepted his new way of life. Half dead
                        and
                        running. When Ebbe joined the Kurgan Kingdom, he began to acquire more and more wealth, and
                        as
                        his wealth grew, as did his dreams. Ebbe would spend hours researching and experimenting,
                        trying
                        everything he could to succeed in his goal, and by the thirty-first of August, Ebbe had
                        successfully revived himself to the form he was in when he died. However, the time between
                        was
                        horrible for Ebbe. He lived in constant pain, often drinking to both forget his past and the
                        pain. The Pig-Man would also have episodes where the undead half would gain dominance, often
                        resulting in the injury of himself and/or others.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Ebbe's Later Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        After serving alongside the Kurgan Kingdom for most of his time in the Overworld, Ebbe
                        eventually left the Kurgans to become a nomadic traveler and trader. He travelled alongside
                        his
                        two dogs, Aurum and Argentum, as well as his mule Carbon. He went on to be a well known
                        merchant
                        across the lands, though despite being well known and accepted, he began to wear his mask
                        and
                        hood again, completely obscuring his face and head. Ebbe would set up camps across the
                        world,
                        often staying at them for months at a time before packing up and moving. He would always
                        find
                        his way back to Kurgan, however, where he would leave offerings at the tomb of Haraldr,
                        visit
                        the horses Flu, Steel, and Bronze, belonging to Ebbe, Einar, and Haraldr respectively, as
                        well
                        as his fox Snær. Eventually, after roughly 90 years of travelling, Ebbe stopped showing up
                        around the kingdoms. Some who he had befriended sent out search parties for him, but all
                        were
                        unsuccessful. Some began to suspect he had killed himself out of the sorrow from some of his
                        best friends perishing, either in battle, or simply natural causes. Eventually, after about
                        a
                        year of searching, someone had happened to stopped on a small island south of Kurgan to
                        spend
                        the night on. This island was where they found an orange eye impaled on a small tree branch.
                        Due
                        to the proximity to Kurgan, as well as how ridiculously rare orange eyes were, Ebbe was
                        assumed
                        dead.

                    <h2>Weapons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ebbe has been known to wield a verity of gear, constantly circulating what's in use. Despite
                        that, he has been known to use a seemingly iron broadsword, with a bejeweled golden hilt and
                        grip, known as Loki's Gift. He also uses an ordinary, though enchanted bow, called
                        Villieldr.
                        There is one weapon he is almost never seen without, however, which are his bloodied
                        netherite
                        gauntlets.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Armour</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Ebbe normally circulates diamond armour, he has been known to own a full set of
                        netherite
                        armour, with two pairs of boots. He also wears the defensive arm mounted shield,
                        traditionally
                        worn by Piglin Brutes.

                    <h2>Gear Preferences</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite many piglins prefering broadswords and crossbows, Ebbe often prefers rapiers and
                        hunting
                        bows, for they're more precise weapons, as well as speedier. Ebbe also prefers to where no
                        armour if possible, but will usually where diamond armour for protection.

                    <p>
                        Before the Shattering, Einar was the chieftain of the small Kurgan clan of Bjørneskog. The
                        chaos
                        brought upon the world by the Shattering was seen as an opportunity by Einar’s clan, who
                        took it
                        upon themselves to grow rich by raiding and pillaging the coastal villages of the Southern
                        Sea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In preparation for each raid, Einar would go into the forest with his wife Yrsa. As his
                        forefathers had for generations, Einar and Yrsa would perform the ritual killing of a bear
                        in
                        honor of the gods, proving themselves capable warriors in their eyes, and thereby receiving
                        their blessing and protection in the coming excursion. In exchange, the clan of Bjørneskog
                        would
                        throw one “Tenth” of their loot overboard as payment to the gods on each return trip back
                        home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, with the ever-growing size of the clan’s pillaged haul, so too did Einar's greed
                        grow.
                        On the return from his most successful raiding trip, Einar failed to throw the “Tenth”
                        overboard, not bearing to see the small fortune sink into the frigid black ocean waters--a
                        decision he would regret for the rest of his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon after returning Einar and Yrsa went into the Black Woods for their ritual hunt in
                        preparation for the clan’s next raid. However, this time they would not be met with success.
                        In
                        the night, a Dire Bear, a gruesome beast of monstrous size attacked Einar and Yrsa. In the
                        ambush, the Dire Bear slashed Einar’s face, ripping it apart and knocking him out. When he
                        finally woke, Einar found what little remained of Yrsa’s body. After burying her, he
                        returned to
                        Bjørneskog. Even before arriving to the village he could smell it. The hoard they had
                        brought
                        back with them from their previous raid must have been carrying a virulent plague which had
                        wiped out his entire clan in the few weeks he had spent away. The entire population of
                        Bjørneskog had been reduced to a pile of rotting corpses. In this way, Einar learned that
                        one
                        does not slight the gods and get away with it. Too afraid to touch anything in the village,
                        Einar left everything he ever knew or had behind, and he started walking North, seeking the
                        forgiveness of the gods.

                        Flavius was knocked out a bit before the Shattering by some falling rocks. He woke up in a
                        cave
                        a bit after the Shattering, having no memory of who he was, not knowing that all of his
                        loved
                        ones had been killed in the Shattering. He wandered out of the cave, and he eventually found
                        a
                        land called "The Varian Empire".

                        named "The Bored Baker". He is currently trying new methods to attempt to get his memory

                        enjoys

                    <p>
                        As a child, Glenn loved to go fishing with his younger brother Morvyn and their father,
                        Chuck.
                        As Glenn's love for fishing increased, his father decided to take him out to sea to start
                        fishing, which his younger brother Morvyn would always beg to come on, but was always
                        denied.
                        When Morvyn was finally old enough to come alone, they decided to go for their first ocean
                        fishing trip. After fishing for hours, they decided to return, during which they encountered
                        a
                        terrible storm, resulting in the death of their father, Chuck. Glenn swam to look for his
                        younger brother, but he was gone. Glenn had no option but to save himself and swam back to
                        the
                        shore to his other younger brother, Amador, and his mother, Leilani. Glenn told them the
                        horrible news and decided to take Amador with him to search for their lost brother and
                        father.
                        Their mother was too old to come with them, so Glenn made the promise to return one day with
                        Morvyn and their father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glenn and Amador searched the land for their brother and father until they reached the shore
                        of
                        Prythonian. After speaking to the King, Morvyn was summoned to finally meet his two brothers
                        that he lost all those years ago. It took weeks of constant reminding of the time they had
                        when
                        they were younger, but Morvyn slowly started to remember everything about his past life.
                        However, Morvyn told Glenn and Amador about his new life with his foster mother, Melwynn
                        Senobryn. Glenn was shocked to see Morvyn had a completely new life and decided to stay in
                        the
                        city of Prythonian with Amador until it seemed like the right time to return. Glenn had made
                        the
                        promise to his mother that he would return, and he intended to keep it that way.

                    <p>
                        Born in Kurgan and lived in Kurgan till her sister died (11). Before her sister died, she
                        was a
                        happy, easy person to be around and very sociable. After her sister’s death, she flipped and
                        became very submissive, the person she is today. She left Kurgan, ran away without telling
                        anyone, one week from her sister's death but had been planning it for six days beforehand.
                        She
                        missed her sister’s funeral and traveled for four years before returning to Kurgan where she
                        was
                        met with her brother at the gate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an attempt to reunite with her brother, she ran over to him. He was on a guarding post at
                        the
                        gate, so when he saw an unrecognized person (because it had been so long he didn’t recognize
                        her), he attacked her. Eventually, after a lot of damage was already done, he recognized her
                        after she said, “It’s me!” and he looked at her properly. They hugged and were reunited. He
                        offered her entry and was so excited to see his sister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stopped him before he got too overjoyed and told him that she was moving into Prythonia
                        and
                        was to become a Prythonian. Hearing this made him upset, but he decided that he didn’t want
                        to
                        lose his sister and risk going to war with her, so he decided to leave Kurgan and go with
                        her to
                        Prythonia. At Prythonia, they met a man called Saber, who took them in and adopted them as
                        his
                        own. They moved into Prythonia; Grenia became a Druid, and Ronan became a Resource
                        Collector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grenia’s eyes are light grey because she is blind. She lost her sight because she enhanced
                        her
                        ability of physical sense, meaning she can physically sense everything around her. She
                        prefers
                        the outdoors because when she is in a room or area with closed walls, she can only sense the
                        area within those walls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grenia enjoys plants, animals, solitude, herbalism, and all living things. However, she
                        dislikes
                        unconditional killing (murder), killing animals (as she's vegan), and crowds.

                    <p>
                        Long before the Shattering, Haraldr was first and foremost a blacksmith. His mother and
                        father
                        brought him up on the craft, and that's where he stuck. He spent many hours forging weapons,
                        tools and metal work for his community. He was well known for his patterned steel axes, and
                        even
                        made a few for the King's guards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As seasonal raids turned to monthly raids, Haraldr was forced to step up and take a leading
                        role
                        in battles. His name was well recognised in his tribe and many others. If the king didn't
                        know
                        him by his axes, he’d know him from his fighting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Shattering was a blow to all life, and to the Kurgans, it was a matter of survival of
                        the
                        fittest. Many fights broke out between the tribes and the King was finding it difficult to
                        instill order. He thought it best to continue raids on those kingdoms which the plague had
                        already ravaged, easy pickings he thought, but in the end it came back to bite him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haraldr led many warbands into the depths of the Galatai borders, crossing into unknown
                        territory and hopefully into wealthy lands. He was soon named Jarl, and overthrew the
                        previous
                        man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the plague started spreading through the Kurgan lands, via slave and gold, the king stood
                        still and feared for his dying people. His advisor, and Shaman to the many tribes, announced
                        the
                        Gods had forsaken them, and that they were set for demise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haraldr defied the words of the king to stay and die, and vowed that those that would follow
                        him, would prosper and survive. They travelled north, and found short lived solitude. The
                        shattering was not over, but neither was Haraldr’s reign.

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hilda grew up in the snowy lands near the Kurgan capital, Ormsa. She didn't have many
                        friends
                        nor much support from her parents who were always busy trying to earn money for the family,
                        so
                        she's quite self-sufficient and likes to do things alone. Hilda has loved plants and flowers
                        since she was a child, that's why she now spends most of her time at her farm or her house,
                        brewing herbal tea, and sometimes stronger drinks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even though Hilda is usually alone, she likes to help others and provide them what they
                        need.
                        She has a strong sense of morals. Hilda is also pretty stubborn and she will do all she can
                        to
                        prove a point, but she's not the type of person to actively start a conflict.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has loved the art of brewery since she discovered it. Even when Hilda was a child, she
                        liked
                        doing small crafts which needed focus and precision. She got this trait from her mother, who
                        used to sew things and sell them. She couldn't survive off of only brewing drinks, so she
                        took
                        up the job of chopping down and replanting trees.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Strengths & weaknesses</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hilda is not skilled at combat at all. Doesn't fight with swords very well and can't shoot a
                        bow
                        that accurately, but she's slowly improving. She has a fear of darkness and hostile
                        creatures,
                        so she always carries around some torches and a shield. She's not very physically strong,
                        but
                        she is flexible and can run fast enough and can easily climb things, including very steep

                        swim very well. Water that's too cold for others isn't that cold for her.

                        Mara is not of royal blood. She was the only child of Suaring’s past architect, and was
                        taught
                        her father’s trade. When Suaring’s previous King died without an heir, Mara was elected as
                        the
                        next ruler. She’s a very passive leader, often doing everything in her power to avoid
                        trouble
                        with other kingdoms. She wants her people to have as much freedom as possible, while still
                        maintaining order. While she does her best to remain passive, she’s not afraid to stand her
                        ground if need be. She does not plan to take a husband or provide an heir. She would much
                        rather
                        prefer that her people choose the next ruler.

                    <h2>The Prythonian Scholar</h2>
                    <p>
                        She is known as one of the very few people in Prythonia familiar with the works of ancient
                        philosophers, scientists and historians.
                        Her knowledge was proven to be useful during the construction of Noviodunum, the co-ruled
                        fortress of Prythonia and Achæa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She's a loyal Prythonian subject of the Crown and also a strong advocate for the democratic
                        principles. However controversial that might seem.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coming from the community of slave-pedagogues who traced their lineage to a once prosperous
                        kingdom, crashed by Prygos, Melwynn was raised in Tiberia. Her parents were teaching a child
                        of
                        their Tiberian master when the Nasyrik plague started. It took many lives of young
                        Tiberians,
                        but Melwynn's kin was accused of creating the sickness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day the guards of her family's master came and startd a massacre, cutting off heads and
                        hands of the slaves and putting them all in massive fire pits. Only Melwynn and some of her
                        siblings could hide under the corpses of many slaughtered innocent people. Melwynn saw as
                        her
                        mother's warm fingers, which she once used to tickle her, wer burning in a fire, the smell
                        of
                        which she wouldn't even forget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mercy was sent upon Melwynn when she and her siblings were rescued by accident by
                        Galatai
                        merchants who set sail right after the little slaves were brought to ship. Unfortunately,
                        only
                        Melwynn could make it to adulthood since all of her siblings lost their lives during the
                        Shattering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She served as a translator for king Cedric when they came back from the mountains.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Memoirs</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the short Conflict between the Kurgan-Varian-Osterwaldian union against the
                        Prythonian-Achaean-Suaring alliance lady Melwynn contracted a disease. The illness and
                        mourning
                        of her late son Robstern had left her unconscious in Tamaris for the vast majority of time
                        until
                        another war came to the Prythonian lands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This time the battlefield was split between the Bastaerni and the Galatai, her souse's
                        nation
                        and her own. This broke her and bedridden her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Melwynn woke up on the next day in the Captured city of Tamaris, she could only hear
                        the
                        voice of her beloved spouse whispering her in the Achaean tongue. And on this day she, the
                        former Gouvernator of Noviodunum, Senobryn mother and wife, heard of the Tragic Morlan
                        demolition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lady Senobryn met in face with the despair itself. Her heart was broken. Her newly found
                        motherland has betrayed her and her family. The Senobryn hill was razed to the ground and
                        the
                        Holy grove of the Senobryn family was burnt to the ashes. On this day the Senobryn family
                        lost
                        their homeland.

                    <p>
                        When Morvyn was a young boy, his father would always take him fishing in the lake next to
                        the
                        forest where he lived. Morvyn never strayed from the forest. He always followed the rules
                        and
                        kept to the boundaries. When Morvyn was 10 his father suggested that they should go out to
                        the
                        ocean and fish there instead. At first Morvyn was unsure but upon seeing the ocean his
                        nerves
                        calmed and he felt very safe alongside his father. The boat sailed out to the center of the
                        ocean and for hours the father and son fished together. On the return home however the boat
                        hit
                        a storm and capsized. Morvyn’s father drowned. But Morvyn was found on the Prythonian
                        coastline
                        2 years later. Unconscious. All he had was a fishing rod his father gave him before he died.
                        But
                        when Morvyn awoke a month later he could remember nothing of his past. No-one knows how
                        Morvyn
                        survived but some believe he can breathe underwater. He was raised by the Prythonians, but
                        all
                        he
                        wanted to do was fish. It was the only thing he could remember how to do. He is the adopted
                        son
                        of Sigfrid of Suaring and Melwynn of Prythonia.

                    <p>
                        His mother died in childbirth, so he has no memory of her at all. Myrddin grew up in a small
                        house in Seurri, the capital of Pyrthonia, with his father (a former guard). His father
                        always
                        provided Myrddin with all the basic necessities: food, water, clothes, and shelter. Myrddin
                        always looked up to his father and wanted to be as skilled as him. He trained whenever he
                        could
                        because he dreamed of becoming the Chief of the Royal Pyrthonian Guards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Myrddin’s 18th birthday, his father died in the night (no one knows how), causing him to
                        lose
                        the house. Luckily, King Cedric gave Myrddin a place to stay and a job as a miner to help
                        him
                        get back on his feet. After a few months, he finally had the courage to ask if he could
                        become a
                        Royal Guard, and Cedric happily accepted the request. Myrddin was overjoyed that he could
                        continue his father's work as a Royal Guard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Myrddin is extremely dedicated to his job, highly intelligent, and very strategic. However,
                        he
                        lacks speed and is relatively young for a guard.

                    <p>
                        A few years before the Shattering, Nonus was born as the youngest of four siblings, in the
                        quiet
                        village of Aeminium, on the far north of the old Tiberian Empire. As a son of poor farmers,
                        he
                        had to work in the field and the forest, to help his family survive. Disliking the muscle
                        work,
                        young Nonus thought up ways to facilitate his tasks. From new field tools to an easier way
                        to
                        chop down wood, and even a better irrigation system for the fields, he was a great help in
                        bringing prosperity to his village.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the rare village festivals, rather than dancing around the bonfire or playing with
                        the
                        other children, he instead listened to the tales of the elders. He was especially entranced
                        by
                        the tale of an old and nearly forgotten God of the Hunt. Using the bow and arrow to hunt
                        down
                        both animals and barbarians, his tales quickly got Nonus's attention, and his eyes glistened
                        every time he heard said story. At the age of 11, Nonus made his first bow and arrows, and
                        started hunting in the woods. With an eagle-like vision, he rarely missed his target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Constantly threatened by the northern barbarians, Nonus was used to see soldiers pass
                        through
                        his village, on their way to defend the borders. During a festival held on the year in which
                        he
                        turned 13, Nonus's sharp intellect and his skill with the bow caught the attention of a
                        Tiberian
                        General. Known throughout the Empire not only as a strategist, but also as a philosopher and
                        historian, he was quick to notice the young boy's aptitudes. And so, he took him to the
                        Imperial
                        Capital, and turned him into one of his pupils.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after, the Shattering occurred. Nonus managed to survive, but his teacher was not so
                        lucky. After some time roaming through the ruins of the old world, he came across the newly
                        formed Varian Empire. Eager to gain more knowledge and to put his master's teachings to
                        practice, Nonus discovered in the Empire a new home for himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He's knowledgeable, a good strategist and a sharpshooter. This is to make up for his lack of
                        strength, meaning that he is also not very experienced in hand-to-hand combat.

                    <p>
                        Panisius was born when his mother decided to have kids and live happily with a bread. She
                        wasn't
                        exactly mentally okay, but she was very clever, so she made a potion that could make
                        ANYTHING
                        live. She created her husband, Mr. Bread. The bread decided to stay with Panisius's mother
                        and
                        raise Panisius. Then they lived happily. One day, ugly people took Panisius from them and
                        ate
                        Mr. Bread alive. That day, Panisius started seeking revenge, seeking something to calm down
                        the
                        heat of his red eyes, which saw the ugliest person eating his bready family, but no. There's
                        nothing that could calm down his rage. From the day he was kidnapped, his eyes never turned
                        back
                        to blue. They stayed red, reflecting his rage inside him that could never be destroyed. No
                        matter if he's in a great mood, living well, or with friends, it will always be there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He lived in Vara for a couple of years, but after not being able to get his needs met, he
                        turned
                        into a mayonnaise explosion.

                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>
                        Regulus was born in a family of farmers. His father taught him how to farm and fish. Fishing
                        quickly became one of his hobbies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His father was forced to go out and fight, Regulus hasn’t seen him since. His mother wasn’t
                        going to let them take Regulus away from her too, so she started teaching him the ways of
                        her
                        family who could communicate with the air; this enhances his hearing and movement which is
                        very
                        handy in getting away unnoticed. He uses this ability to fish even better!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is a proud follower of The Dolphin Gods, which means he can see them in their actions and
                        understand them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His biggest wish is to one day, see his father again.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Political Life</h1>
                    <p>
                        Regulus campaigned to become one of the first senators of The Varian Empire. His slogan was
                        "Livelier Vara". His goals were to bring life into the Empire by whatever means possible:
                        letting animals roam free, having more greenery, more Varians, ... and to make it look
                        beautiful. He delivered his campaign in book form to Varians by putting it in their
                        mailboxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He held a debate with Cornelius behind The Colosseum, where he answered the questions of
                        others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He won his position as senator with 6 votes.

                        Sigfrid was born on edge of Varian territory while their parents were buying materials for
                        cheap
                        but was quickly smuggled back into Suaring territory. After a few months Sigfrid's parents
                        were
                        being blackmailed by a witness to their child being born on Varian soil but, business had
                        been
                        tight and they were unable to fulfill their payment for a few weeks. This caused the
                        blackmailer
                        to send a few bandits to scare Sigfrid’s father into paying but the bandits got drunk along
                        the
                        way and ended up killing the father. Now with the family’s main source of money gone and a
                        new
                        child, things were looking grim. The blackmailer stopped contacting them for unknown
                        reasons.
                        Sigfrid’s mother had to sell the bakery and find a new job but few people were looking for
                        bakers. After a few weeks a new job opportunity popped up but it was dangerous work as a
                        smuggler. Now with a job, Sigfrid’s mother was able to get a small room and food. This
                        continued
                        until Sigfrid was 16, which is when his mother got caught. With no money, Sigfrid sold all
                        of
                        their belongings except for a small blade which he kept in his boot. With a good
                        understanding
                        of the criminal world he was able to get a few small jobs for transporting illegal goods
                        over
                        the border. After a few months the Shattering occurred, but instead of crumpling up and
                        dying he
                        was
                        thriving within the chaos. With the excess loot from the dead he was able to raid many
                        castles
                        and sell the weapons. This lead to Sigfrid being the top seller in weapons but that want
                        saying
                        much with the few people still remaining.

                        The plague had little effect for his area, but the monsters did with almost daily attacks.
                        It
                        was
                        hard to find any time to sell weapons. One night he awoke with the sound of screaming and a
                        bright flash of an explosion. Apparently someone had tried to kill one of the creatures with
                        a
                        trap but had an early detonation and blew off a few of their limbs. Sigfrid ran out to help,
                        but
                        saw the horde of creatures that saw the explosion and abandoned the helpless man screaming
                        at
                        him for help to die. As he ran he realized that nothing was there but misery and nightmares.
                        It
                        was a few nights of sleeping in bushes and eating nothing before be found other people.
                        These
                        people had been a family of fellow Suarings but many of their families had died and only a
                        three
                        remained. With hours of planning they set off to find a way of escape but they had been
                        separated in the harsh forests. This left Sigfrid alone once more. Luckily weeks later he
                        found
                        a
                        group that already had a boat and were about to leave. Relived, he hopped aboard and left
                        for
                        the
                        new lands, but he found a note tucked into his sleeping quarters bearing the last name of
                        the
                        family written in blood made out of skin. Horrified he threw it off the ship into to the
                        depths
                        of the sea. Still not knowing how it got there or if it was imagined he stayed awake for
                        weeks
                        to scared to sleep and this is when is mistrust of everyone began.

                        Torsten grew up with his family on a farm before the shattering. He worked hard for the
                        family
                        and always had dedication in him. He'd work every day cutting down trees, or working on the
                        farm. Torsten was not exactly a fighter. He did not focus on combat as he rarely needed to
                        from
                        working on the farm. Although he was skilled at archery from hunting. They say he had the
                        eyes
                        of an eagle when it came to firing an arrow from a bow.

                    <p>
                        When Torsten was only 17, The Shattering started. Torsten's family struggled as they were a
                        small family on a farm. They could not protect themselves from raiders and disease. Torsten
                        and
                        his father did everything to protect the family until his father became too sick to fight.
                        They
                        were dying and Torsten knew it. He knew he had no choice but to leave to seek help. Torsten
                        ran
                        for days in search of help until he found a small settlement with a couple of people. They
                        people told him there was no saving his family and he had to stay with them if he wanted to
                        live
                        after The Shattering. Torsten grew up with these people and worked hard for them. Although
                        he
                        would never forget his family.

                        No one knows who he is, but neither does he. All he remembers was being in the middle of a
                        army
                        of wolves lead by the nicest man who he ever knew. He was a blacksmith, a lumberjack, a
                        hunter
                        and a pet lover who raised him as his own son and taught him to be his helper, friend and
                        mostly
                        partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His mentor was taken by the Shattering. At that moment he felt pure rage. He saw some 20
                        varians
                        soldiers and killed them all in a matter of seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was exiled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His mentor's wolves found him and lead him to the Kurgans who started trusting him. He then
                        got
                        blessed by the gods for his loss, because some say they feared his wrath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He's a powerful fighter and a nice man when not drunk or angry. He's also a skillful
                        lumberjack,
                        hunter and blacksmith. Wild animals like wolves and bears like him and follow him around.

                        When he is angry, he is able of killing everyone in his path; allies and enemies alike. He
                        is
                        not suited for ranged combat and is occasionally grumpy in the sense of killing whoever
                        wakes
                        him up that morning. When angry, his body form changes between being wolf and man.
