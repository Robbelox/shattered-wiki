            The Empire of ShÅ«ri
        </h1>
        <p>
            The people of Shuri were born from the other realm, the warrior people of a foreign world. After being
            stranded in this new and bountiful land, they immediately sought to take it for their own. They banded
            together and claimed a large island quite close to the divine portal that they had come through.
        </p>
        <p>
            They started to refine the land, creating food for their people and weapons for their army. It looked like
            it wouldn't be long until they conquered the entirety of this new world, but with every great empire comes
            great tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A group of power-hungry warriors wanted more. They staged a revolution, killing multiple mighty generals
            under the cover of night. They hung these heads outside their windows, showing mighty gestures of war. And
            so they fought, tearing the once mighty empire into shreds.
        </p>
        <p>
            After centuries passed of constant battle, the people were starting to grow tired of war. It was a waste of
            resources and destruction of entire cities. The warriors didn't want to fight anymore, and so a new leader
            appeared to usher them into an new era - an era of peace.
