                        <p>The art of using materials, mundane or magical, in order to concoct brews for a variety of
                            effects. This is most frequently seen through potions, and can be applied to a target

                        <p>Relying on ancient runes (base galactic) of unknown origin, Enchantment can infuse objects,
                            tools, and weapons either through directly carving specific rune combinations onto the
                            surface of the object, or by transferring the power of a rune combo onto it. Runes must be
                            extremely specific, and even the smallest error in their writing can render the enchantment
                            dysfunctional. Books can be an excellent form of storage for specific combinations of runes
                            to later be grafted to their final target.</p>

                        <p>A form of magic lost to time, with little to no modern practitioners. It said they were
                            capable of casting 'spells' without the aid of enchantment or alchemy, though the validity
                            of these tales are extremely unreliable. It is said those who practiced were the first to
                            travel the dimensions, and constructed not only the ancient strongholds and their dormant
                            portals to the End, but the original gateway connecting Ayka and Verdan. They supposedly
                            died out centuries before the first Shattering.</p>

                            About
                        </h1>
                        <p>A naturally occurring material that is inherently magically charged. Unlike electricity, it's
                            charge can
                            be maintained by passively absorbing faint magical energies in the environment. It can be
                            toxic if
                            ingested in large quantities, but in smaller amounts has been used as a strong spice on
                            foods and in
                            drinks.</p>

                        <h1>Electricity</h1>
                        <p>Despite misconceptions, electricity and redstone are almost entirely unrelated. Redstone is
                            capable of
                            holding a brief electrical charge, however it is extremely inefficient at conducting
                            electricity.</p>

                        <h1>Sickness</h1>
                        <p>It is not uncommon for those who often work with redstone in enclosed spaces to inhale it. If
                            not
                            properly prevented or treated, these redstone particles can clump and re-crystalize,
                            creating
                            long-lasting respiratory issues. In severe cases, this can lead to death.</p>

                        <h1>Alchemy Uses</h1>
                        <p>When used in brewing potions, redstone powder is known to extend the duration of the
                            concoction. This is
                            done by acting as a form of magical sponge, absorbing the effect of the brew, and releasing
                            that effect
                            over a longer period of time as the body metabolizes the dust.</p>
