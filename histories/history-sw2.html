            The Story of Verdan
        </h1>
        <p>
            The survivors of the Shattered World finally reached peace after many attempts and battles; Over the years
            Empires rose and Kings fell. Time went by and the people's descendants started to forget, occasionally they
            would stumble upon ruins of destroyed houses, and forgotten builds. Very rarely they also came upon those of
            fortresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day a portal was found, far away from the main lands. Only a few were brave enough to enter it at first,
            but it was soon discovered to be harmless. The lands on the other side of the portal were rich of resources
            and ore, and naturally the Kingdoms of the once Shattered World sent their people to settle in the new
            realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first the new lands appeared endlessly fruitful, but soon a territorial war broke out between the
            Kingdoms. The war was short and brought death for hundreds of soldiers and innocent settlers. The end of the
            war came when one group decided to take control of the portal by building around it and stopping people
            enter. A large battle broke out around the fort, a battle between equal forces. Only a few of the initial
            500 Soldiers were still standing, beaten and struggling for breath, when one noticed that the portal had
            been damaged.
        </p>
        <p>
            What appeared as a slight crack grew to be a large gap in the structure of the gateway in seconds. When the
            soldiers realised what was happening, it was too late. The frame of the portal fell apart, and with it, the
            connection between the two worlds was ceased.
            <br>
            The collapsing of the portal was the end of the battle, as the remaining soldiers quickly realised they
            could not survive without one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people of the Shattered World survived, and eventually started growing in number. They started to see
            their situation as an opportunity and went to explore the new worlds. Eventually some settled, while others
            kept on travelling. Many years went by, and new kingdoms and empires were founded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fate of the Shattered World remained unknown except for a name: Verdan.
