                    <p>
                        Aisha is a redheaded Central Fae with striking green eyes. Her hair changes shades of red due to
                        climate and seasons. She appears to be in her 20s, but she has actually lived for over 2
                        thousand years, barely tapping into her lifespan's potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is a kind, outgoing yet reserved woman. She is kind to strangers, quick to care and
                        difficult to anger. However, she is slow to forgive once she is wronged. She tends to give
                        people the benefit of the doubt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aisha Licho was born in a small Central Fae town outside the protection of the kingdom of Maria,
                        to the Lichos, a respected family in her town. She was sickly for the first couple hundred years
                        of her life, but eventually befriended Kato Dira, her best friend and closest confidant for many
                        hundreds of years. Due to the Fae not having proper sex education (at least not in their
                        hometown), the two ended up accidentally having a child, Avie Licho.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sadly, Aisha's entire world came crashing down around her when her entire village was murdered
                        in a raid for their wings, leaving Aisha the only known survivor. She wandered Iteria for
                        hundreds of years, lost in her grief. Eventually, she found herself around Nindal, where she was
                        discovered by the Sakari Order leader, Wilhem. She joined the Sakari Order, seeking a sense of
                        purpose and belonging, thus beginning her story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After joining the Sakari Order, Aisha's life settled into a tranquil routine. She embraced her
                        new community, tending to her farm and honing her brewing skills. With time, she found solace in
                        the regrowth of her wings, symbolizing inner peace restored. This tranquility endured as she
                        crafted a perfect home amidst the rhythms of Avisburg.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, this serenity was disrupted when Andrew of the Brotherhood emerged, threatening to seize
                        control of Avisburg and imperiling Aisha's safety, perhaps even in the presence of Teri. Amidst
                        these tumultuous events, Aisha tragically witnessed the permanent demise of her friend
                        Ghostbelio at the hands of Niko, a haunting moment etched into her memory alongside Teri's.

                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <p>
                        Alcaeus is a natural-born elf with fair skin and hair as white as snow in which it is highly
                        noted by his family that he had suffered a "hereditary disease". His hair, however, is tied in a
                        half-ponytail most of the time and lets it down whenever he wants to. Alcaeus inherited his eyes
                        from his family members, however, they are in a shade of pale or dull blue in color whereas his
                        family have natural and properly colored sky/ocean blue eyes. Standing at 6'1 ft. tall, Alcaeus
                        is slightly tall than his brothers and has a lean, muscular body, however, despite his healthy
                        physique, he suffers a couple of wounds around his torso, mostly when engaging in a battle
                        between the undead whenever he encounters one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alcaeus often dons a dull greyish-blue jacket and what seems to be a greyish-cyan chestplate
                        underneath it accompanied with a belt. His pants are ombre-blackish in color whereas his pair of
                        boots are colored in black. He is usually seen wearing a pair of black gauntlets on both of his
                        hands and frequently wields either an iron sword or a dagger on his main right hand. Alcaeus has
                        a deadpan look on his face and is sometimes seen as very tired-looking (mostly because he has
                        been living as a nomad for quite some time now).
                    </p>

                    <h1>Traits</h1>
                    <p>
                        Alcaeus is depicted as a quiet, mysterious, and calm man by most of his family members and
                        acquaintances before his departure as a nomad. He is often seen as a man with a unique sense of
                        humor despite his signature deadpan look on his face. He is very mature, brave and is unafraid
                        of the unknown, however, he is still wary of the dangers lurking all around him during his
                        journey as a nomad in Iteria. Alcaeus' presence may be quite intimidating to others but so far,
                        he frequently emanates a benign aura to let others know that he is no threat to them. Alcaeus
                        has a natural soothing voice and during combat, his voice would often have a sharp tone to it,
                        especially when he yells in which he rarely does it so. Additionally, he speaks in a very formal
                        manner and seems to find informal words fine to him and cares less of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite his calm and mysterious features, he is often seen as a serious man, especially in
                        combat. Having no knowledge of magic nor had he ever taught himself to cast a simple spell, his
                        acquaintances see him as a valiant warrior fit to be a guard for the royalty however, Alcaeus
                        avoids being in a business with a monarch and prefers to be himself. This shows that despite his
                        bravery and excellency in combat, he prefers to live in solitude and survive by himself in such
                        a harsh world filled with unique wonders. In combat, he has precise movement and does not act in
                        a barbaric manner, he is keen in his surroundings and to his opponents, watching them like a
                        predator hunting its own prey without having to act like a savage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even as a noble-born Elf, his interests are captured when it comes to unique architecture and
                        structures built by any being or entity in Iteria. While being a noble, he is surprisingly not
                        finicky to others or to the artifacts he has collected and prefers giving them away just in
                        case. When storing artifacts that are no use to him, he either throws it away or leaves it in an
                        abandoned chest, hoping for someone to make use of the artifacts he has never used very much.
                    </p>

                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>
                        Alcaeus [pronounced as al-SEE-yus] Galadher was born to a noble family somewhere in the distant
                        lands of Iteria and was the youngest son of the House of Galadher to ever inherit the noble
                        bloodline. Often shunned by his own flesh and blood because of his lack of interest in magic as
                        well as his own hereditary disease, Alcaeus was more of a man of combat, frequently seen by some
                        of his family members whenever he is practicing his swordsmanship with his acquaintances. With
                        his family being renowned as skillful casters, they were also known for their great skills in
                        combat, in which some of his family members often find Alcaeus as not much of a disgrace to his
                        own family as he was able to learn the basics of combat with ease. Hearing this, Alcaeus cared
                        less of what his family had talked about him and decided to follow his own path in honing his
                        skills in battle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon his training, he was greeted by his aunt and his father's sister, Hortensia Amatheldir (nee
                        Galadher) after her engagement with the heir of a different noble house. During their meeting,
                        she tasked Alcaeus to travel all over Iteria to find a great teacher who was skilled in magic
                        just as what his father had told him years during his training at the battlefield in which
                        Alcaeus knew as to why he was coerced to his departure. Due to his lack of interest in magic,
                        his own parents would soon grew worried of their youngest son's future and how it may affect the
                        noble reputation of the House of Galadher should he not listen to their advices, especially his
                        father who, despite being concerned of him, was revealed to be a strict parent to his own sons.
                        To Alcaeus' annoyance, his father would soon make a decision several days later that his son
                        shall depart from his homeland and travel all around the outskirts of Iteria to find a teacher
                        who is skillful in magic and casting spells. Should Alcaeus fail, his father would warn him to
                        never return back home if his only skill was to simply fight with weapons. Alcaeus did not seem
                        to care much about his unfortunate fate of what would happen to him and to the House of
                        Galadher, he accepts his father's decision and began his departure in the cold, dark, winter
                        evening without even saying his own farewell to his family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many years have passed, his family has not seen his presence return and assumed he would never
                        come back not unless he was able to train himself the basics of magic but, in truth, Alcaeus
                        spent the entirety of his life living as a nomad in the outskirts of Iteria while his skills in
                        combat still remain in him. Even as a nomad, his noble surname would remain visible in the
                        public eye for the rest of his life, knowing that any inhabitants of this place would care less
                        of where he came from and his origins as the son of a noble family.

                    <h1>Story</h1>
                    <h2>Life as a Nomad<br>(Meeting Voldonaire)</h2>
                    <p>
                        After Alcaeus' departure from his homeland, instead of paying heed to his family's advice, he
                        sought to travel in the outskirts of Iteria by himself and lived for the past few years as a
                        nomadic elf. He made sure he wouldn't return back home should his father made that very decision
                        of coercing his own son to seek for a teacher to instruct him the basics of magic, in which he
                        intentionally failed him. As of now, Alcaeus continues to travel in the outskirts of Iteria and
                        was able to see different structures, abandoned villages, encountered monsters he fought by
                        himself, and most importantly, arriving at Hiraeth by accident in which he assumed that the
                        place was already abandoned. Upon his close inspection at that very place, he begins to meet a
                        stranger named Voldonaire in which he seemed to have no interests talking to him that much,
                        however, his interests would soon spark as Voldonaire took him to a place he had never traveled
                        before: The World Tree. There, he was brought to a place in which he had stumbled upon a dead
                        entity of a demonic bloodline in which he was told that this being was powerful, yet, had died
                        due to the crystals that would emerge from its body and the Tree itself. Strangely enough, he
                        finds himself sympathizing over a powerful entity he has not known much in his life, yet, at the
                        same time, he would care less of it and hoped that any brave or valiant warriors all around
                        Iteria would stop the plague of crystals emerging all over the outskirts of Iteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alcaeus and Voldonaire returns back to Hiraeth in which they would soon share their farewells
                        with one another, hoping Alcaeus would one day meet him again, unaware of the stranger's odd
                        nature. Before they left to travel all the way back to Hiraeth, he was given an Ominous Horn and
                        a strange compass that acts as some sort of radar in which it would let him know if there are
                        any people near him. Unfortunately, in the midst of his long journey, he happens to lost the
                        artifacts that were given to him, in which he was quite disappointed of it. Even until now, he
                        would still think of the artifacts on where they're at, hoping he would find them someday. After
                        the events that occured to him as a nomad, he and Voldonaire had not crossed paths with each
                        other again in which Alcaeus assumes he left for his own important journey...

                    <p>
                        When Asher was very young, his parents abandoned him at the doorstep of a poor family who
                        reluctantly took him in, despite not being able to provide very much for him. The family already
                        had many children, and Asher became just another child to care for. They called him Arrow at
                        first because one of the other children had just found an Arrowhead in the backyard. Asher came
                        around after he fell into an ashpit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward to the day that Zombelio died, Arrow finds himself in a strange place. “Othium…”
                        Asher was in Othium and was confused. He found some old stuff in a chest and decided to steal
                        it. He then found Sakari and met who he would, in the future, marry, and her name was Aisha. He
                        joined Gatesmen when he wandered through their nether portal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a few months, and Asher finds himself in a sticky situation. Asher had been
                        imprisoned by Andrew, Leader of the Brotherhood. Asher thought if he joined the Brotherhood that
                        maybe they would set both Aisha and Avie free, but that plan did not work. Asher soon found
                        himself trying to dig a tunnel, tunneling into Aisha's cell so he could see her. He proposed to
                        Aisha after getting beaten within an inch of his life by Ozen. Asher, Avie, and Aisha escaped by
                        the hands of Sten when he set all three of them free. He soon joined the Merchant's Union, where
                        he stayed for a long time. Asher, after a few months, moved back to Gatesmen where he currently
                        resides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Asher woke up recently, about a month ago, and realized there was a voice besides his own in his
                        head. The voice is that of Ghostbelio, who once fell to Niko and his ways.

                    <h1>Story</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ebbe K. Prime, originally Letoius of house and clan Prime, was born to a Piglin mother and a
                        Human father who had been blessed by the gods long ago, allowing for the unatural cross-breeding
                        of Humans and Piglins to procede. His mother, not wanting to deal with a child in the harsh
                        wastes of the Nether, left the infant with a passing clan: clan Prime. It was here that the
                        child was adopted by Tyerelius, the leader of the clan. Letoius was given his name, and
                        travelled alongside his father for years to come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In time, the Nether came under a great seige, a war between Ender and Piglins. Many Piglins of
                        the time thought it the end of their species, their kind scattered and disorganized. It was
                        here, with nothing but spunk and luck, that Letoius managed to ralley several clans together,
                        fighting off a large hoarde of invading Endermen. As the small Piglin army continued their
                        crusade against the invading Ender, Letoius became a hero among many Piglins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In time, the Nether natives managed to form of a unified front, with Letoius as their
                        figurehead. When they eventually managed to defeat the oncoming hoardes of Ender, driving off
                        their years-long assault of the fire wastes, Letoius was apointed king of their new unified
                        group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was now that the young half-Piglin's luck ran out. He knew nothing of running a kingdom, and
                        it swiftly fell to ruin via riots and a small civil war. By the end, the kingdom's own military
                        turned on their king, and locked him in the prison, wishing to hold a public execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a bloody scuffle, Letoius managed to escape, fleeing the nation as the most wanted man in
                        Piglin society. Letoius ran and ran for months, until he stumbled across a lit portal from the
                        old trade routes with the Overworld. Desperate to escape his past and with nothing to lose, he
                        went through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The instant he stepped into the Overworld, he was overcome with overwhelming pain as he began to
                        zombify, skin and muscles sloughing from his bones. Letoius would have, and should have, died,
                        but the faint traces of magic in his blood from his blood father kept him concious in the new
                        painful form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Overworld at this time was free of the monsters who came to plague it in years come, and as
                        such Letoius was an exotic beast to be hunted down. As decades passed, he became a local legend,
                        a boogeyman to scare children. He tried to build up his arsenal, but due to his nomadic
                        lifestyle of avoiding hunters, he was never able to aquire anything more than what he could keep
                        on his person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, something both awful and amazing happened: The Shattering. The Shattering was a
                        catastrophic event that split the ground, releasing horrifying monsters from the earth, as well
                        as a deadly plague. It ruined the world, toppling empires that had reigned for hundreds of
                        years, but for Letoius it was a gift. No longer the center of attention from hunters, and immune
                        to the plague due to his undead state, Letoius was more free than he had ever been in his
                        seventy years in the Overworld.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now equipped with nothing more than the clothes on his back, his family blade, his gauntlets,
                        and a mask fashioned after the withering undead of the Endermen that had invaded his home,
                        Letoius set out to try and find a place in Human society. In time, he found his way to a city
                        known as Tiberia, where he met two men: Haraldr and Einar. Haraldr was the leader of a once
                        great clan known as the Kurgan, who had been all but wiped out by the Shattering, and was taking
                        pity on any who were lost, inviting them to the clan. Letoius, hiding both his undead and Piglin
                        traits behind a hood and a mask, donned the name Ebbe from the Kurgan dialect, and joined the
                        clan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was here that the trio, Haraldr, Einar, and Ebbe, travelled back to the wild lands claimed by
                        the Kurgan, and began to work. They gathered wood and ore in a small camp around a ravine, that
                        later blossomed into the mining town of Braka Hellir. Haraldr later left the town to begin
                        construction of the soon-to-be capital in the eastern mountains, leaving Einar and Ebbe as the
                        leaders of Braka Hellir.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ebbe spent much of his time in the mines, desperate to be useful to the people who had taken him
                        in, while Einar often travelled back and forth from Braka Hellir and the work in progress
                        capital, Ormsa. As the clan grew, as did the capital, leaving Ebbe and Braka Hellir a remote,
                        but important, cog in the machine of Kurgan. Ebbe documented his life and his secrets in a diary
                        which he labled "Logs of Letoius." It was his first taste of writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A spy and assassin from an enemy kingdom, Prythonia, snuck their way into Braka Hellir one
                        night, and while he did not steal anything, he did read Ebbe's diary and became the first to
                        find out his secret, unbeknownst to Ebbe. He eventually revealed his zombification and Piglin
                        heritage to Einar, a man he considered a brother in all but blood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunetly, it was around this time that Haraldr became deathly ill. It was a heartbreaking
                        development for Ebbe, but he was used to loss. As the clan leader and king had no heir, the
                        Kurgan, with Haraldr's blessing, held a vote to appoint a new leader. Einar was initially voted,
                        but he turned it down, not desiring the responsibility that came with the power. In his place, a
                        man named Torsten became the new leader of the clan. It was not much later that Haraldr was
                        claimed by the illness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just before Haraldr passed, though, the Prythonic spy ended up joining Kurgan, revealing his
                        name as Conan. Admitting his spying around Ormsa and Braka Hellir, though not his knowledge of
                        Ebbe's secret, Ebbe was suspicious of the man. But he came with Haraldr's express blessing, and
                        so he was forced to accept it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During Ebbe's stay in Kurgan, he found himself growing more wealthy, and with a stockpile of
                        resource growing faster than the kingdom he supplied them to used them. With the alien feeling
                        of free time, Ebbe began to research topics of a more scientic nature. Specifically, what it
                        would take to revive his physical body, and keep it from zombifying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his research, he found he needed a combination of a weakness potion, and enchanted golden
                        apple, a totem of undying, a nether star, and the infused power from end crystals. And so, he
                        began his journey to revive himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He became closer friends with Conan in the coming months, bonding with him in the search for a
                        Totem of Undying for Ebbe's revival, as he did with the new king Torsten. As months and months
                        passed, Ebbe and Conan became best friends, and became something of an adviser to Torsten.
                        Torsten shared with Ebbe the secret recipe to the Kurgan Brew, a powerful drink known only to
                        the must trusted of the Kurgan clan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuing with his experiments, Ebbe befriended the leader of the kindgom of Osterwalde,
                        Auduin. The man was interested in many academic studies, and was willing to help Ebbe with
                        gathering the resources for the procedure, viewing it as a once-in-a-lifetime oppertunity for
                        study. It was also around this time that Ebbe began to speak to the god Loki, and was given the
                        gift of a magical broadsword.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time went on, as did life. Ebbe got closer to gathering the resources needed, lacking only the
                        crystalized souls at the heart of a Wither. Unfortunately, Ebbe got lazy and impatient, and
                        decided to go on with the experiment without the star. At first it seemed a success, but it was
                        not long until side effects started to show. A violet eye at first, but soon his skin turned the
                        same black as the Ender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As more and more years passed, the infection grew wider and more expansive. Ebbe left the clan,
                        becoming a nomadic merchant across the kindgoms, but eventually succumbed to his infection,
                        gouging out his one remaining orange eye so a small part of him could remain uncorrupted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was now that Ebbe stopped being himself. Corrupted by the Ender in both mind and body, Ebbe
                        became a prisoner in his own brain, a servant and slave to the Ender. As thousands of years
                        passed, this Ender became sentient, a creature known as The Harbinger in time, and travelled
                        from Ebbe's original world, to Iteria. This was done by corrupting an End Portal with alien
                        magic, redirecting the portal from the End to a realm known as the True Void. However, Ebbe's
                        struggling against his mental captor through them off course, lost in the teleportation realm.
                        Through sheer chance, the creature was hurled into another rift, dropping them into Iteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Harbinger created an organization known as the Gatesmen, became allies with the then-leader
                        of Hiraeth Serenity, but eventually fell to a trap to purge the Ender from Ebbe set up by the
                        Eternans Julius, Niko, and Abelio. While Ebbe was intially grateful for finally freeing him, it
                        was quickly morphed into distaste as Niko attempted to hold him prisoner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ebbe managed to break free from the cell, fleeing through the Nether and running to Avigsburg.
                        It was here that he became allies with Wilhelm, the grandmaster of the Sakari Order. It was here
                        he hatched a plan for a new group: The Tunnelworker's Union.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, at the Desert Villa, Ebbe recruited a half-Ender by the name of Ellery. The duo tried to
                        create an alliance with a small up-and-coming faction, but were sold out to Niko and ambushed.
                        However, a Human named Barry who worked with the Sakari Order who ran a tavern known as the
                        Broken Barrel were willing to join.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the trio had excavated a home for the Tunnelworker's Union, they recruited their final
                        member: a fae named Gwynden. Ebbe and Gwyn became quick friends, their pasts quite different but
                        sharing similar enough elements to find common ground. Gwyn became Ebbe's best friend in Iteria,
                        being the only person he felt comfortable confiding in fully about his past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which is why when they seemingly disapeered, and Ellery left, Ebbe disbanded the Union, moving
                        to a remote location that only a small trusted few knew of. Ebbe constructed a small home there,
                        but once Ender Chests stopped functioning, he left his home in order to seek answers. That was
                        the last anyone had heard of him, and he left his most precious belongings behind for his
                        friends.
                    </p>


                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <p>
                        In his prime, Ebbe was 5'4 in height, and had long floppy ears that started near his scalp on
                        each side, just above where normal humans ears would be. Unlike normal piglins, Ebbe's skull
                        wasn't as wide, and his eye sockets weren't as round. This is due to only being half piglin, and
                        being what Ebbe had dubbed a "Pig-Man." His skin is a light brown, similar to the colour of
                        dried dirt. Physically, Ebbe is 97 years old, which is considered early middle aged or late
                        young adult for piglins. Ebbe also has two tusks coming from the sides of his mouth at an angle.
                        Each are 6¼ centimetres long.

                    <h1>Backstory</h1>
                    <p>Hundal was born as the son of a Human and Elf, making him a Half-Elf; his parents cherished
                        him.
                        He doesn't remember a lot about his parents but he knew that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His mother, Rhavonne, was seen as foreign. The elves didn't enjoy the prescence of people
                        without
                        elf-blood flowing through their veins. As tensions grew between her and the tribe, she was
                        cast
                        out.
                        "Follow your heart," were the last words she spoke to baby Hundal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hundal lived his toddler years in the Hundelle tribe. It was a hard endeavour to take care
                        of
                        little
                        Kaitun, but his father persevered. Without him, Hundal wouldn't have survived, as the tribe
                        did
                        not warp
                        an eye on him. Hundal was seen as impure in the tribe, which made it hard for his father to
                        keep
                        him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As time progressed, it became obvious that Hundal wasn't going to spend his teen years in
                        the
                        tribe. As
                        he grew older and gained knowledge of the world, the aversion of the tribe grew. They called
                        him
                        Chkatan
                        Hundal out of disrespect and distanced him from the tribe. His father knew it was urgent to
                        teach Kaitun
                        how to survive. He taught his son about plants, shelter and the art of hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He knew that Hundal wouldn't be able to remember everything at that age. He proceeded to
                        switch
                        to
                        teaching basic skills as writing and reading. In the meanwhile he wrote a small pocketbook
                        of
                        what he
                        was trying to teach before. Whenever Hundal would need something, he would be able to find
                        it in
                        this
                        book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The time had arrived; Hundal's father couldn't procrastinate any longer. Hundal was banished
                        at
                        the age
                        of 8 and had to survive in the wild with the aid of his father's book. In his first years,
                        he
                        made do
                        with foraging, but as he grew older, he started to dabble in the Art of Hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once in a while he stumbled upon a settlement where he set up camp for a while. In his early
                        years,
                        people would have mercy with him, but as he grew older he had to use his long fingers. He
                        used
                        these
                        settlements to stock up, but whenever he did, he had a bad feeling in his heart. He knew
                        stealing wasn't
                        right and made do with the bare minimum. Since then, he has always had a disgust for people
                        who
                        do for
                        wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He spent fourty years as a nomad and kept learning new things which he added to his father's
                        notebook.
                        During these periods he mostly hung around with animals, as he had grown paranoïd of
                        humanoids.

                    <p>
                        During one of his learning expeditions, he stumbled upon a burning village with goblin camps
                        on
                        the
                        edges. He decided to investigate it and called it Mission Green Goblin. During this mission,
                        he
                        worked
                        together with some animals: Wilkins (Dog), Smittens (Cat), Fiddles (Donkey), Rasuza (Dog)
                        and
                        Kat (Cat).
                        He found some buildings around, but no real clues of any Goblins. He wrote his findings down
                        in
                        a diary.

                    <p>
                        During his investigations, he was found by Wilhelm, the leader of the Sakari Order; who
                        promised
                        him
                        futher investigations when he would join. Hundal proceeded to accept the offer and joined
                        the
                        Sakari
                        Order where he documented . The world started to change shortly after: meteors became a
                        common
                        thing and
                        nature stopped.

                    <p>
                        The goblin investigation promise was never fulfilled as there were now bigger things to
                        investigate.
                        Plant growth is an important matter in terms of survival. Without, Hundal had to make use of
                        his
                        hunting
                        proficiency more as time progressed.

                    <p>
                        An expedition towards the north of Nindal came into the planning of the Sakari Order. It was
                        during this
                        expedition where Hundal began to talk to a couple: Teri and Niko. Hundal lost track of
                        Wilhelm
                        and
                        decided to stick with those two; that's when a meteor storm approached. The bunch decided to
                        take
                        shelter in a cave, which has become a big part of Hundal's life. They went to a big tree,
                        and
                        that is
                        where Hundal left the expedition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in Avisburg, life became boring when Wilhelm went missing. To spend his time, Hundal
                        formed
                        Hundal's Horse Homes; where he analysed the Sakarian horses and took care of them. During
                        this
                        period,
                        he got acquainted with Ashari Oakenheart who owned a mule called Fenton. Hundal targetted
                        this
                        mule to
                        be the first one to be analysed. Ashari was against that, but after hanging around Ashari's
                        house for
                        some time, he did it anyways. This caused some people to suspect him for beastiality, but
                        that
                        faded
                        away after a while. After some weeks, he moved out of the house he was given and built a
                        small
                        lodge
                        next to Ashari's house. The grass began to grow again shortly after.

                        Member

                    <p>
                        Shortly after, Ashari invited him to The Gatesmen. There he was told about the mission:
                        digging
                        away a
                        1001x1001 perimiter; thus Hundal started to work. He dug away some ground, drained all of
                        the
                        rivers and
                        chopped down a reasonable amount of trees. The last two mostly being due to a punishment he
                        was
                        given
                        for protecting the Gatesmen Tower from Harry, who was intruding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There, Hundal became good friends with Ghostbelio with whom he worked away, but after some
                        time
                        Ashari
                        passed away due to a failed ritual and Ghostbelio left The Gatesmen. Hundal hadn't seen
                        Ashari
                        for weeks
                        before the ritual and hasn't since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Ashari's passing, the leadership was transferred to The Harbinger, but Hundal never
                        saw
                        this black
                        pig as his rightful leader, as he thought Ashari was still alive. The Harbinger disappeared
                        too,
                        and
                        with the two previous leaders missing in action, Hundal took the position as leader of the
                        Gatesmen
                        after finding a message. With it, he found a mysterious crystal, which he put inside of the
                        ender bag
                        which came with it. Whispers started to echo through his head asking him to join.

                        Ghostbelio came back with the company of Niko and an unknown person, but not on good terms.
                        They
                        attacked Hundal, leaving him severely wounded for unknown reasons. When they left, Hundal
                        patched up his
                        wounds. While doing that, he heard footsteps in the main hall of the tower. He took a look
                        and
                        found the
                        young, unknown, white-haired person who came with the two attackers. He used all his
                        strength
                        and went
                        to talk with the boy who was appreciating the tower. He managed to lead him to the dungeons
                        where he
                        asked for explanations. The boy, Ozen, explained that he went with them because he was
                        looking
                        for
                        something to be a part of. Hundal grew fond of Ozen and asked him if he wanted to become a
                        Gatesman,
                        which the boy accepted. Along with Ozen, they were now the two remaining Gatesmen, as
                        everyone
                        had left
                        after the passing of Ashari.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hundal decided to stop the dig and divided the capital project into smaller, more enjoyable
                        steps. The
                        first projects being cleaning up and improving existing builds. Together they transformed
                        the
                        tower into
                        an impressive castle and fixed up the basement of the tower.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the cleanup, Gatesmen joined and left. One of them being Ghostbelio, he was on a
                        quest to
                        become
                        human once again and became an undead by once again connecting to his body. He ended up
                        being
                        murdered.
                        Ozen grew and became a worse person after time, which Hundal did not want. At some point
                        Ozen
                        became too
                        psychopatic, which caused him to be kicked out by Hundal with the promise of him being able
                        to
                        come back
                        once he had changed his ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another problem was the crystal taking control over Hundal. The whispers became louder and
                        louder.
                        Hundal couldn't ignore them anymore and was willing to go in on them, doing what his head
                        was
                        telling
                        him. In his bed he had a faint memory, "Follow your heart," he remembered. This was followed
                        by
                        another
                        voice whispering in his head, "Follow your heart, Kaitun. You can choose your own path now."
                        Hundal took
                        the crystal out of his bag and threw it into the End Gate which has been sitting in the
                        basement
                        for
                        ages. His head became silent and his heart glowed, he became aware of another feeling:
                        magic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The End Gate was sending out strong waves of magic which made him feel a flow of energy. He
                        studied them
                        and learned how to use them for movement. With his knowledge, he created The Gatesmen Castle
                        Elevator
                        and the Gatesmen Castle Gate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New people came knocking on that Gate: Arrow, Elyon, Tulip... As well as some familiar faces
                        asking for
                        forgiveness. Niko and Ozen rejoined the Gatesmen and are becoming good people under the
                        teachings of
                        Hundal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Rising Tensions
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A couple of months later, Ozen killed Avie by accident which caused him to be depressed.
                        Although Hundal
                        doesn't like what he did, he still helps Ozen through it as he has experienced depression of
                        all
                        types
                        himself. When Sten and Aisha intruded, Hundal was up for protecting Ozen by lying, but a
                        contract he was
                        forced to sign would have been the cause of his demise. The negotiations went harm-free, but
                        tensions
                        had risen between Hundal and those two, they wouldn't be touching Ozen over Hundal's corpse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not too long after, Aisha came to apologise, while Sten wrote a trading contract for a spear
                        Hundal had
                        acquired. This got him his Chinmoku No Shi back, and trust slowly began to grow again. They
                        were
                        not
                        allies, but they could stand each other more or less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was until the coronation of the Ashaiian Queen, where Sten went insane and slashed
                        whoever
                        he could
                        to grab whatever amount of gold he could get his hands on. With a pierced back, Hundal
                        considered the
                        attack the last straw; he lost all of his trust in Sten. It was a long and painful walk
                        home,
                        where he,
                        with a lot of effort, healed up again. Not too long ago, his protective staff was stolen,
                        wherefor he
                        had to purchase a new restorator. He got help from a new Gatesmen called Alcaeus Galadher,
                        who
                        got
                        taught the lesson of never putting all of your trust into a person.

                    <p>
                        Kyle Kordall, of the great house of Kordall, left at the age of 21 to find his own glory in the
                        world. He moved out and found two brothers by the names of Stekard and Bakren and agreed to join
                        them in their goal of setting up a tavern. Once the location was found, Kyle built his own
                        encampment on the other side of the river and was there for the formation of the Steak and Bake
                        Corporation. After a few weeks, he and Stekard got into a fight over some weird abstract art,
                        "art even a Shender dragon would find disgusting and would smite him down for it," as Kyle would
                        put it. This caused Kyle to leave Steak and Bake Co soon after its formation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On his new travels, he found a thief by the name of Bellum and became close friends. While
                        originally Kyle did not approve of thieving, recent events such as the formation of the Nova
                        Trading Corporation, a cover scheme for the illegal practices of a faction with the Corporation
                        containing both Bellum and Kyle called the Brotherhood of Steal, alongside the loss faced by
                        Kyle in the arena games, giving him deafness in his left ear, have all contributed to a loss of
                        sanity and a lust for power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowing he lost out on a Blue Dragon Egg in the Arena games to Sten, he now craves more power.
                        However, he is not jealous of Sten. All he has is respect for the man who has everything. For
                        the man who, just like him, is a businessman. Alas, once the business is done, all that Kyle
                        wishes for is when his death comes, and it will. It will be the Shender Dragons who fear his
                        power that smite him down. Alas, the story only begins. War is on the Rise.

                    <p>
                        Mino was a male Fae of the Northern variety, who used to be 2000 years old. Mino was always
                        interested in combat, but Mino’s parents, Gem and Bill Tempest, always told him to learn about
                        building. Mino, always striving to make his parents happy, learned about building and forgot
                        about his combat dreams. Mino was a happy, kind person, at least that's what he thought he was.
                        So, when Mino learned about a Fae living outside the Kingdom of Maria named Aisha and learned of
                        her house location from a mutual friend, he started becoming pen pals with Aisha. Eventually,
                        Mino was so eager to visit her that he did. But while walking out to the house, he met a
                        ghoulish man named Zonan building what seemed like a castle. Mino stopped and talked with the
                        man. The man kept talking about a person named Niko and how they would pay. Whenever Mino tried
                        bringing it up, Zonan would flinch and continue building. But when Mino started talking about
                        himself and how he was there for Aisha, Zonan said, “Oh, you're the person mailing Aisha, yeah,
                        she’s in my cells.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mino, enraged by their pen pal being imprisoned, grabbed the nearest sword and started swinging,
                        but not one hit. Zonan eventually calmed Mino down and talked it out with him, revealing that
                        Zonan was planning to help with her escape and building this castle to live free. Mino, feeling
                        so bad for Zonan, told him he’d help build the castle. After learning about Zonan’s death, he
                        told himself he’d build that castle if it was the last thing he’d do alive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He died when he stood on a mushroom to hard.

                    <p>
                        A man with snow-white skin and white/silver hair. His right eye was violet and slightly pink,
                        while his left eye had a reddish-brown tone. The shape of his face was round, and the skin
                        around his eyes was physically worn out, tired-looking, and slightly red. He had a slightly
                        tall, lean, muscular body. His arms looked like they were sewed back in many places, the skin on
                        them slightly purple in color, almost rotting. Ozen, even if he didn't mean to, gave out
                        unnaturally bizarre smiles whenever glancing at others. And whenever he talked to people, he
                        liked to get into their faces, disregarding their personal space and their feeling of unsafety.
                        His movements were heavy and alerting; he did not tend to hide himself when engaging in battle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever he talked, he often switched his head left and right and rarely ever made eye contact.
                        His lips tended to stay more shut than open unless something funny got into his head. His voice
                        was fairly normal; unexpectedly, it had more of a sharp tone to it. When he was actually in
                        battle, his quieter self changed into more of a maniac, childish behavior. Because of his
                        well-built muscles, he could move quickly towards others and hit them with precise movements
                        learned from excessive experience. When he won a fight and got his opponent either killed or
                        knocked down, he grinned and laughed at the weakness of them.

                    <p>
                        Sten grew up in a small village; he liked to watch wandering merchants come to his village and
                        sell their wares. He always had a great interest in becoming a merchant as he wanted to explore
                        the world and see its many wonders and treasures. Then one day, a merchant came to his village.
                        Sten approached the merchant and asked him about the places he had been to and the things he had
                        seen. The merchant told him about many wondrous things and about the many places he had visited
                        and the many people he had met. The merchant then showed Sten an artifact he had picked up along
                        his travels, an item he called the 'crown of avarice'. He told Sten that it was a powerful
                        enchanted artifact that would bring great luck to whoever wore it. He then told Sten to wear the
                        crown. As Sten put on the crown, he felt a tug in his soul and a small urge for 'something'. The
                        stranger then told Sten he could keep the crown as he was fond of the little lizardkin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Sten grew up, he realized he always sought rare and glittery things. It started with him
                        collecting pretty stones in the lake, and then he started to hoard gold and sell things he
                        hunted or found to other lizardkins or wandering traders, and this urge to get that 'something'
                        grew stronger and stronger until he gained the middle name 'Greed' from his tribe. When he was
                        16, he set off from his village as a merchant, hoping to sell his wares and find that
                        'something'. When he was 17, he happened to meet a wandering fae named Lyra. They traveled
                        together as Lyra became a guard for Sten's merchant caravan. They traveled for a few years and
                        visited many places, slowly growing a friendship along the way, becoming one of the few people
                        Sten trusted. Slowly Sten's merchant group grew and grew until his group became one of the
                        largest merchant groups in the land.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Sten was 21, his merchant group was thriving and gathering for a 4th-year anniversary of
                        the group, inviting all employees and members to join. When the party was ongoing and they were
                        all having a jolly good time, a crack in the sky opened and spewed out CRYSTALBORNS, which then
                        began slaughtering everyone in sight! As Sten fled the party, he looked to find Lyra but
                        couldn't, no matter how hard he looked. Lyra seemed to have vanished into thin air. After this,
                        Sten became more and more greedy so that he would never suffer such a tragedy again. He
                        collected weapons, armor, tools, explosives, magics, everything he could get his hands on. He
                        practiced with all the weapons he could to become stronger and stronger, vowing to find what his
                        avarice told him to and to eliminate all crystalborns.

                    <p>
                        From a young age, Teri wanted to move out and live life fully. Seeing all that nature offered,
                        the world seemed so open and inviting to explore. And once the opportunity arose, she ran away
                        from home, being certain that a wild life is what she wanted - living on her own; she dreamed
                        about wandering until she found a place to settle down, she dreamed about living in a small blue
                        house in the middle of a forest and not caring about anything other than her animals and crops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teri spent more than a year traveling by herself, visiting the world and all its secrets,
                        although sometimes only barely surviving the challenges provided by nature itself. As time went
                        on, those challenges got more and more tiring, and suddenly she realized she needed something to
                        rely on, be it a place or a community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So she made her way over to a camp that she had seen from afar while wandering in the birch
                        forests. To Teri’s surprise, she was welcomed amongst the nomads staying there - especially
                        Mulac, a mysterious man who looked like he had some magic abilities in his possession, and
                        Purity, a friendly man who she got along with quickly. They informed her of their plans to
                        settle down near a volcano, but at the time she refused and went on to travel a bit more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that period of time, Teri built the little house that she had always wanted to live in, but
                        fairly quickly she understood that living in a set place alone wasn’t for her. She got back to
                        the volcano and agreed to stay with the nomads, who called themselves the Sect of the Fallen
                        One, and to help Mulac with his mission, offering her work in exchange for food and basic
                        resources she had been lacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teri was never a person to start believing in something quickly, so the Sect’s dedicated work
                        for the saving of the Heart of Nature seemed strange to her at first. Soon enough she got
                        accustomed to it and the mentality got to her too, in particular after a conversation with Mulac
                        where he explained their goals truthfully, didn’t hide anything about his actions, including
                        stealing the Heart. It made Teri slowly gain more trust for him and start to believe in their
                        goals - to change the world for the better, release the power from the Heart so that everyone
                        can live in even better conditions than before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She helped out with construction of the camp and providing resources for builds, while others
                        began construction of the Forge. The Battle of the Volcano made her rethink a lot of choices.
                        Mulac was the closest person to her, he felt almost like family, and losing him in the End broke
                        something in Teri for a while. Him being missing was even worse than if he had died and been
                        found - at least she could have said her goodbyes and gotten rid of that small bit of hope,
                        hunched down in the corner of her mind.

                        A new dawn came. Eterna was formed, but it never felt the same way the Sect did to her. The Sect
                        had a strong goal uniting everyone, even more than that - a vision of a better future. All
                        Eterna offered in itself seemed to be a living place together with the people she already knew.
                        Teri started thinking about going back to the nomadic life, now that Nature was flourishing
                        again. She didn't trust people easily, thought that she was very independent and could take care
                        of herself (not always true), was good at keeping secrets and minding her own business when
                        needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes she could be hotheaded, but usually tried to manage her emotions. She cared about and
                        was loyal to people who had gained her trust, at the moment they were Niko and potentially some
                        other Sect members. Teri was willing to help others out and show kindness to most, especially if
                        she understood their thinking or the reasoning for their condition. She also cared a lot about
                        people living in the same neighborhood and people from Eterna, as they were the ones that she
                        got close to.

                    <p>
                        In a time since forgotten, not long after the fall of the Vi Empire, a young girl known as
                        Vivian Kal had her village raided by bandits. The men were slaughtered, while the women and
                        children were taken captive. However, Vivian's time in captivity did not last long, for she was
                        swiftly bought by a man she had hoped to be her saviour; a powerful arcanist, experimenting in
                        the practice of necromancy in the hopes of achieving immortality. His hopes were that, by
                        finding a way to track exactly where souls went after death, he would be able to recall a soul
                        back to its mortal flesh from it's resting place in the beyond. In time, he determined he would
                        need to infuse the soul with a material that could transcend dimension and plane, in order to
                        summon it forth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vivian was the first soul subject to his experiments after making this revelation. It took many
                        long months, but in time he successfully infused the girl's spirit utilizing the crushed extract
                        from ender pearls. The only thing left was for her to die, so he could recall her. However, the
                        experiments proved a failure, and after being murdered, Vivian's soul was set adrift, drawn not
                        it's natural resting place, but to the dimension who's energies had been infused within her: the
                        End.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unable to be recalled, unable to pass on, Vivian wandered the desolate wastelands of the End for
                        longer than any mortal should, her mind fracturing and breaking and dumping everything it needed
                        to in order to survive. For countless years, the broken, spectral husk of a woman sat alone -
                        until someone, or rather something, was able to put her back together. Her past forgotten,
                        Vivian, or Vivi, was visited by the voice of the deity known as the Conqueror, an
                        extra-dimensional goddess of the Void. Needing a follower, an acolyte to inact her will, the
                        faint whispers of the Conquer led the girl to a peculiar, black and purple crystal. Now in
                        possession of a Void Crystal, a powerful and rare phenomenon caused by pooling void magicks, the
                        Conqueror's voice became clear. The deity, to whom Vivi owed her repaired mind, guided the
                        spectre, the Voidwalker, to freedom - a return to the Overworld.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The woman, rebuilt as the Conqueror needed, was cruel and tactical, and of a mind dedicated
                        solely to the summoning of her Goddess. When entering a society so unfamiliar to her, Vivi used
                        her diminutive voice to her advantage, playing dumb in order to earn the charity of others, all
                        the while constructing labs and running her own experiments in order to, one day, summon her
                        goddess. While she created many alliances and had many deals, her only allegiance has ever
                        belonged to herself and her goddess.
