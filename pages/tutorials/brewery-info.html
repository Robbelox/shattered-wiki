            <h1>Consumption</h1>
            <h2>Drunkness</h2>
            <p>
                To check how drunk you are, do /brew info.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get rid of drunkenness, you can:
            </p>
            <ul class="centered">
                <li>Wait;</li>
                <li>Drink huge amounts of milk;</li>
                <li>Eat bread (twice as effective as milk).</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Production</h1>
            <h2>Fermenting ("Cooking")</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Setup Required:</b> A cauldron over a heat source (fire, lava, etc, personal recommendation: magma
                block
                - quiet and not dangerous)
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Fill the cauldron with water.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Right-click to add ingredients held in your hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Wait as much as your recipe requires.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Check the time with a clock by right clicking (won't be consumed).
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Take it out with glass bottles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The taken out liquid for most alcoholic drinks show you the name of the drink base, such as
                "Potatomash",
                "Fermented wheat, "Boiled herbs" and many others. This most of the time means that you need some other
                step
                to complete the drink. (Sometimes this is not the case and you just used an incorrect amount or an
                incorrect
                timing). This brings you to the other steps: Aging and Distilling.
            </p>

            <h2>Distilling</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Not all drinks require distilling!</b> For some of them you'll need to skip right into Aging.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Setup Required:</b> A brewing stand with 1 glowstone dust in the top slot.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Place your fermented potion in the brewing stand.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Wait. Some potions require more distilling rounds, some less - wait until it stops completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Take out your drink.
            </p>

            <h2>Aging</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Not all drinks require Aging! Some might only need Distilling or neither of them.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Setup Required:</b> a vanilla barrel, a small Brewery barrel or a big Brewery barrel.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Vanilla Barrel:</b>
                <br> - Holds up to 6 drinks.
                <br> - Counts as an oak barrel.
                <br>
                <br><img class="no-zoom" src="images/Barrel.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Small Barrel:</b>
                <br><b>Required Materials:</b> 8 stairs & 1 sign.
                <br> - Holds up to 9 drinks.
                <br> - Can be any woodtype.
                <br>
                <br><img class="no-zoom" src="images/SmallBarrel.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Big Barrel:</b>
                <br><b>Required Materials:</b> 18 wood planks, 16 stairs, 4 fences, 1 sign
                <br> - Holds up to 27 drinks.
                <br> - Can be any woodtype.
                <br> - You can remove the sign after creating the barrel.
                <br>
                <br><img class="no-zoom" src="images/BigBarrel.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                After creating a custom Brewery barrel, you should get a message in chat saying "Barrel created". You
                can
                then open it by right clicking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Place your drink into a barrel and wait for it to age. Some drinks can be aged in any woodtype, some
                need a
                specific one (e.g. Darkbeer, which needs Dark Oak). 1 year for Brewery is 1 Minecraft day (=20 minutes
                IRL).
            </p>

            <h2>Complete?</h2>
            <p>
                You'll know when a drink is complete if its name and stars show up on it. At most you can get 5 stars on
                a drink, this means it's of the highest quality. The text on the drink will show which parts you did
                best: green is perfect, yellow/orange is inaccurate, and red is quite far from perfect. (This depends on
                the difficulty (set in the config file) of the drink you're making: the more difficult, the less you
                need to fail for stars to be taken away).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're aging the drink and the aging time shows up as red, you may need to wait more (or you've
                already over-aged it, depends on your case, so keep an eye on your drink). Same for distilling - it may
                not be distilled enough yet.
            </p>

            <h2>Sealing</h2>
            <p>
                To prevent a drink from aging when placed in a barrel, you can seal the drink by placing it in a Brew
                Sealing Table. It is crafted by placing 2 glass bottles above 4 planks in a square, similar to how you'd
                craft a fletching table.
            </p>
            <p>
                Place your drinks in the Brew sealing table and take them out after a few seconds (you should hear a
                bottle pop noise). This cannot be undone.
            </p>

            <h2>Dealing with Failure</h2>
            <p>
                So you messed up and now you've got a bunch of Ruined potions or Murky distillates? You can use a hopper
                to quickly dump their contents to gain your bottle back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dealing with emotional failure that you can't dump? Your potion was failed? Try again, maybe try
                perfecting it by using a different amount of ingredients or a shorter/longer fermenting time.
            </p>
