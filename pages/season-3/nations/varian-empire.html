                Historically, The Varianâ€™s are a faction many consider an upstart, a band of fools playing as a nation.
                A
                small group has tried to stake their claim and build the great Varian Empire for countless generations,
                though rarely have they ever grown powerful enough to pose a threat to any established nation. They have
                tried their hand at being seafaring nomads, cave dwellers, and everything in between, to no avail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many are confused by the Varianâ€™s undying loyalty to their historic hope, not understanding why so many
                generations continue to try to establish a nation that fails time and time again, always pushed back to
                the
                brink by those in power. The truth is hardly a secret the Varians keep, it is simply that no one is
                bothered
                enough to hear their story.
            </p>
            <p>
                In time immemorial, there was a mighty nation known as Tiberia. Little of its formation is known, other
                than
                that their point of origin was a long-dead colony. The mighty general known as Tiberian repurposed the
                abandoned town, and used it as a starting point for his and his armyâ€™s campaign across the known world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tiberian conquered neighbouring cities with ease, and grew a prospering empire known as Tiberia.
                Tiberia,
                despite the impressive military it bolstered, often had little use for it. Due to its well structured
                government and central location, people came to them. Towns would offer themselves to the growing nation
                for
                its protection and just governing so that they too could revel in the life Tiberia gave.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tiberian Empire was ever growing and ever successful for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, the old
                addich rang true: The larger they are, the harder they fall. In a great disaster that swept the land,
                almost
                the entirety of the Tiberian Empire was destroyed in a matter of days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most prominent Tiberian state to survive was that of Vara. The mighty city withstood the ravishing
                of
                the land, and vowed to rebuild their Empire to last all of eternity. The Varian Empire stood tall for
                countless years, one of the strongest powers in the world, before eventually being buried under the
                tides of
                time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since, the most loyal to The Varian Empire have remained generation by generation, trying to
                rebuild
                their great nation in order to complete the promise made by their ancestors, so many years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the disaster of the Culling, the great powers of the world were brought to their knees, crippled and
                ravished just like Tiberia before them. Following in their predecessors footsteps, The Varian Empire
                will
                have to rise from tragedy once more.
