                            About
                        </h1>
                        <p>A pig-like humanoid species native to the Nether. Due to having evolved in the Nether's
                            life-sustaining
                            environment, they are incapable of surviving outside of it without zombifying. Due it's
                            life-giving
                            properties, Piglins see the material "gold" in an almost holy view.</p>

                        <h1>History</h1>
                        <p>They were on peaceful terms with inhabitants of the Overworld for many years, even having
                            permanent trade
                            agreements with the ancient Bastaernians. However, when war from extra-dimensional invaders
                            began to
                            ravish the Nether, the portals connecting the two were severed, primarily due to the
                            influence of Achaea
                            and the Tiberians. Ever since being abandoned in their time of need, Piglins have held a
                            deep distrust
                            and hatred of humanity. The written language of the Piglins was scarcely used even in
                            ancient times, and
                            is unheard of in present day, as such all most to all history is oral.</p>

                        <h1>Culture</h1>
                        <p>Piglin society can be broken into Clans and Houses. A House is a family unit, typically
                            consisting of
                            anywhere from ~10-40 members. A single member of the House is chosen to lead and represent
                            them. A Clan
                            is a collection of typically 3-9 Houses, with a single House Leader chosen to be a Clan
                            Leader, with the
                            other House Leaders acting as advisors. Leaders are chosen not just for strength, but for
                            charisma,
                            wisdom, and cunning. They are a nomadic species, unable to make permanent settlements in the
                            hostile
                            environment, and as such these groups will tend to skew on the lower population side.</p>
