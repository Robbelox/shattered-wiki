        <h1>Sect of the Fallen One</h1>
        <p>
            It was above all. It gazed upon the realm with a sense of love and peace. It was a being full of love for
            the pure creatures which inhabited its world, doing all it could to bring joy to their lives. However, it
            understood that some things weren‚Äôt meant to be. There was scum on its plane, it had to be purged. So It
            destroyed the filth and wiped the slate clean. However, some of the entities were jealous, their minds had
            been corrupted by the filth.
        </p>
        <p>
            A jealous entity decided he wanted that power for himself, she struck out at him, stealing his name and
            power. The imposter took the name ‚Äúgoddess of nature‚Äù and also stole all of Its followers. The heart powered
            the plants of the world, making it an invaluable artifact to the corrupted. After the fall of the Old Gods,
            Iteria was left godless. Fortunately, the power of the Old Gods remained, and from their lingering magic,
            new gods rose.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of these gods, simply referred to as "It," swayed the minds of its realm, a large and isolated portion
            of Iteria. However, It started to notice it was losing its followers. And so, it did what the only logical
            thing It could think of: Genocide. It massacred Its people, wanting to start over with a clean slate. Such a
            method would have seemed barbaric and vicious to a mortal, but to a god, it was but simple logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started to regain Its following with new subjects who would not be tempted away from It. Or at least,
            that is what It thought. There were other gods, lesser gods, who wanted Its power. Most were too fearful to
            do so, but there was one with the skill, bravery, and willpower to do so. The lesser goddess knew it would
            need an item of immense power to trap a god, and so she traveled to the gravesite of one of the Old Gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            She dug through the mighty forest that had grown around it, until she had reached her prize. A green heart,
            no bigger than one of a human. Such a powerful item would be powerful to contain It. This, this would be her
            ticket to the top. The way she could topple It. Most other gods, large or lesser, thought she was mad, but
            she did not let this deter her. And despite all the odds, she was victorious. She was able to hold the power
            of such a powerful god within the heart of Soltus.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so, this goddess took the place of It. Claiming she was the Goddess of Nature, she took the followers of
            It, and a new day dawned on Its realm. However, there were some who were not so easily convinced. They knew
            It had not simply disappeared as the Goddess of Nature claimed, and they wanted to return their god to Its
            former glory. They began to refer to him as "The Fallen One," and it was not long until they knew he was in
            the Heart of The Forest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The filth started to spread and the memory of It started to disappear in the passage of time. However, a
            small clan of people remained pure and managed to keep worshipping It by calling It by a new name, ‚ÄúThe
            Fallen One.‚Äù They continued to hunt down the heart, hoping to one day restore It to its former glory. Years
            passed and the clan slowly dwindled until only one member remained, but he remained steadfast in his search.
        </p>
        <p>
            His search led him to a magician named Mulac who was said to hold a power that defied all others. Mulac led
            them to a secret forge which held the power to crack the heart open, and so the sect went to work. The
            sect‚Äôs plans failed, however, as the heart was stolen before the forge was complete. Mulac disappeared
            before the faithful fight at the forge. In a desperate attempt to escape, the sect fled through a portal
            into a brand new dimension. They then split up and are currently planning ways to resurrect It once again.
        </p>

        <h2>Side Stories</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the original sect members got drunk, revived the ancient guardian of the End and proceeded to kill
            him with their bare hands. Good times.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sect got raided by an Illusioner and his cronies. One suicidal possessed man and 2 actually competent
            warriors managed to defeat them and get some cool bows.
        </p>
        <p>
            That one time the sect actually managed to win in pvp. Weird stuff.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Shadowhoods</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Centuries ago a group of knights and priests from the lands conquered by Alexis formed a group to keep their
            cultures alive. They succeeded for a while but slowly their beliefs faded away, only a couple of ‚ÄúParagons‚Äù
            kept tomes and continued to tell their stories to their children. This resulted in the survival albeit
            barely of this religion. Their original name was lost and became Shadowhoods. Only the name of their God
            Emisis wasn‚Äôt forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Shadowhoods are now a small group of alchemists, knights, priests and others that accept new followers
            and keep believing in Emisis.
        </p>

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
            Emisis, the God of Souls. It controls the cycle of life by reincarnating the ones that follow its name. The
            Shadowhoods‚Äô biggest fear is to not be reincarnated, dying enternally means that they have not believed in
            Emisis sincerely. The shadowhoods live in dark buildings because it represents the endless cycle of life
            given by their Deity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Paragons of the Emisae are the leaders of the Shadowhoods, they possess the knowledge of the Black Tome.
        </p>
        <p>
            The priests learn about the religion through parts of the Black Tome. The priests‚Äô mission is to spread the
            beliefs to Followers. Followers are anyone that follow Emisis or the Paragons. peasants and even lords can
            become Followers.
        </p>
        <p>
            All members of the Shadowhoods wear black, the paragons, priests and paladins wear the Emissae symbol on
            them.
        </p>

        <h1>Eterna</h1>
        <p>
            The Empire of Eterna was created not too long ago, when Wilhelm of the Sakari order and Julius, Architect in
            the Sect of the Fallen One at that time, talked about whether a new faction should be created. Julius was
            unsure at first, but could not seem to get rid of the idea. So when the time was right, he gathered people
            and founded Eterna.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not soon after, most members of the Sect followed him, the Sect was no longer an independent faction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main goal of Eterna is growth. Attracting people, and building towns and cities across Iteria with the
            idea to allow people to do pretty much whatever they like and also to encourage trading. However, it was
            clear from the beginning that a military force - if not at least for defensive purposes - would be required.
            These goals were fairly ambitious, and it was also clear that it would take some time to get there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eterna has no own religion. The Sect of the Fallen One is the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù religion inside the Empire but no
            one is forced to join it.
