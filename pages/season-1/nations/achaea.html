            <h1>
                History
            </h1>
            <p>
                Ask any Ach√¶an where civilisation began, and they will quickly reply that they, of course, created it.
                The
                Ach√¶an history goes back thousands of years, and in that time they have invented many things that are
                often
                seen as the pinnacle of civilization. Things like philosophy, medicine and architecture were
                revolutionised
                within the Ach√¶an lands, something that the Ach√¶ans have always been proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ach√¶an people have been divided for much of their history, being split into a multitude of tiny city
                states vying against one another for land, wealth and slaves. Although they all share the same culture
                and
                language, they differ vastly on their principals. You may find one city state that relies upon slavery
                and a
                king like in Leontinoi, while another has a democracy and even allows slaves to vote within it, like
                Pyrgos.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two leading city states have warred many times for dominance, each collecting a coalition of
                cities to
                join their side. While Pyrgos uses its strong navy to control trade and the seas, the Leontinoi use
                their
                disciplined army to control the lands. Due to this standoff, neither side has managed to take over the
                entire peninsula and unite the people into a single unified nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are Ach√¶an colonies across the southern seas, stretching the length of the entire continent. These
                colonies have adopted their native land as well as that of the Ach√¶an, resulting in a mismatch of
                languages
                and styles. The most famous of which is the city of Tiberia, which managed to conquer the surrounding
                cities
                to create an Empire that went on to take much of the known continent. Including their homeland of Ach√¶a.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally united, although under the Tiberians, the Ach√¶ans were treated relatively well, even if they did
                have foreign troops garrisoning their lands, taking their slaves and killing their people. As time went
                on,
                this resentment started to grow. The Tiberians supported centralisation, and this meant that the
                wealthier
                grew stronger. If it weren‚Äôt for the continued infighting, and stagnant corruption that consistently
                plagued
                the lands, there was a real chance of a civilisation that could rival even the Tiberians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ach√¶ans were one of the first to perish from the great disasters and sicknesses, only coming after
                the
                Tiberians, due to their close ties both through trade and government. Much of the population was
                decimated
                in the first few months. The remainder were forced to survive through countless raids from the
                barbarians,
                who arrived in their land to loot and pillage what remained of their glorious lands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the Ach√¶an people turned from the gods, believing this to be a divine punishment, and took part
                in
                a series of mass suicides that claimed what little remained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, some people were led away from the disasters, sickness and foreign invaders, hiding in the
                hills
                and mountains. They struggled to survive, but their unbreakable faith in the gods allowed them to
                continue
                on through the pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that the land has settled, and the continent divided, the people are led back into their homeland,
                ready
                to rebuild the most civilised nation the world has ever seen.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Religion
            </h1>
            <p>
                At the center of Ach√¶an mythology is the pantheon of deities who were said to live on Mount Pelion, the
                highest mountain in Ach√¶a. From their perch, they ruled every aspect of human life. Pelionian gods and
                goddesses looked like men and women (though they could change themselves into animals and other things)
                and
                were ‚Äì as many myths recounted ‚Äì vulnerable to human foibles and passions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ach√¶an gods are highly diverse, each of them representing one part of nature, or humans. This can
                vary
                from being an emotion, like a god of anger, to a nature spirit whose lifeforce is tied to a certain
                river.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Customs
            </h1>

            <h2>
                Bathing
            </h2>
            <p>
                The most well known custom of the Ach√¶an People is bathing, they will bathe in the sea before going on
                any
                voyage, near or far, this is to gain favour and luck from the god of the sea before they set off on a
                journey. They will also wash each other the day before battle. This is so that the soldiers are washed
                of
                all fear and will be bold in their fights ahead.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Friendships
            </h2>
            <p>
                Friends are not to be made lightly, making acquaintances and being good friends with another isn't
                something
                the Achaenan people take easily. They may seem standoffish to begin with, but you are on a good
                direction to
                gain the person's trust the sooner they start lightening up and being more kind. Friends are seen as
                lifelong and breaking a friendship or breaking trust between a friend is seen highly unseen, the one to
                break it will be seen as less than in wider society and will be shunned until the friendship is renewed.
