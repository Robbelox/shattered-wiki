        <p>
            The realms of Meridion are one of the oldest nations in the world. Their history dates back hundreds of
            years, to a kingdom in a far off land of which Meridion shares its name. Like all the other nations, during
            the Shatterings their home was overrun with monsters and brought to ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such had happened before, and was bound to happen once more. It was a recurring travesty that the people had
            grown accustomed to, and as such became experts at quickly erecting new towers and constructing new forts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike before, though, this Shattering brought particularly bad quakes, and left the land of which they
            built upon unfit for construction, and nearby land unusable for crops.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people of Meridion were forced to migrate, wandering the world to find a land willing to accept a new
            kingdom as their neighbours. Over the years, the people of Meridion were cut down by the environmental
            hazards of the Shattering and the monsters that dwelled in the wilds of which they trekked.
        </p>
        <p>
            They wandered for a hundred years, building unstable shanty towns to stay at for several months before
            leaving for their journey once more. Their ancient mighty castles could no longer be constructed under such
            short periods. As they continued to move, the vast people of Meridion slowly dwindled.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the skies turned red and the Culling was upon the world, the people did not fare well. What little
            loyalty the people held for the state and royalty was tested almost to breaking point. Only for their own
            mutual benefit did they stick together.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the Culling was the worst tragedy to have affected the Meridion people since the Shattering that had
            ruined their homeland, it was also their greatest blessing. The turmoil the world felt after the Culling
            left a window open for those who remained. The Meridion people knew this may be their only chance to make a
            home where they could feel safe again, regardless of the name it held.
