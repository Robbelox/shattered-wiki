                The Lands of Zurtu
            </h1>
            <p>
                The natives of this land had few settlements, but none were as small as the northern tribes. Their land
                was
                dry and barren, and every year was a struggle to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                That all changed when the portal was opened. A few farmers and labourers travelled to the desert in
                search
                of prosperity and away from the domineering Shuri. They found this poor tribe and took them under their
                wings, teaching them techniques and helping them prosper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people started to hear rumours of more war in the south, they then hid themselves away further into
                the
                treacherous desert. Many people searched for them, but they had long since disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently however, the tribe has decided to reveal itself to the world, with both the Shuri and the
                Valdelor
                being heavily crippled, they deemed it safe to appear.
