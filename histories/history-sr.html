                The Story of our Shattered Realm
            </h1>
            <p>
                Roughly a millennium ago, the world was struck by a horrific tragedy; the event shook the land itself
                and
                formed vast cracks in the earth. Brought forth were plagues that swept the lands, and monsters that
                clawed
                and dragged their way to the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                The event became known as the Shattering.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the mightiest empires to the smallest clans, all were affected. The people were slaughtered en
                masse by
                the horrors that blanketed the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the decades passed, the world began to rebuild. Nations that had persisted for thousands of years
                prior,
                since time immemorial, remained strong and true.
            </p>
            <p>
                As many had privately feared, the denizens of the world could not hold the peace. A hundred years after
                the
                Shattering, and each and every century that followed, the Shattering would rear its head once again to
                inflict pain and destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time passed the people grew less and less afraid. Not only could they rebuild with ease, but also
                prepare
                for the recurring event. Adjusting to the undead and other horrors stalking the lands, the average
                person
                grew more fit and able. Many had learned to wield a blade in combat.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the wilds of the world, away from the now thriving civilizations, a band of explorers stumbled across
                a
                unique structure. Upon return, they boasted of their discovery to all who would listen. Few believed the
                claims of the men. Who could believe something as far-fetched as a portal to a new world?
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearing a year of the adventurerâ€™s boasts, they finally convinced one to listen: a researcher. The
                researcher was a distinguished scholar, said to be of royal blood from times long forgotten. Upon seeing
                the
                portal for himself, he shared the findings with his peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following year, nations from every corner of the world became aware of it. This was not a widely
                known fact, but among the ranks of nobility, the thought became worrisome. In order to fuel their
                nations,
                they mined and harvested all that was available. With wild excitement, the nation leaders led their
                people
                to the new world beyond the portalâ€™s gate.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the largest of empires forced their passage, many were denied, left behind, or simply did not wish
                to
                journey within. During the following territorial war, the portal was destroyed and the connection
                between
                the worlds severed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who remained in their homeworld were left to pick up the pieces. With the communities small and
                the
                most skilled gone, the centennial Shatterings crippled who were left.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the nations of the world were finally starting to heal, a new tragedy arose. Only a year ago the
                sky
                fell upon itselfâ€¦
            </p>
            <p>
                The Culling did not bring forth new monsters or plagues, but spectral reapers of all forms and sizes.
                The
                night was a massacre, and the rivers ran red with the blood of the innocent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once more the nations were torn asunder. From the rubble, the survivors will have to rebuild what was
                once
                again lost.
