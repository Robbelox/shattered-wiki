            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                The Kingdom of Ashai started out in a village in the small Hamlet of Haven as the Shake & Bake
                Coorporation, where the two young Rennyn brothers adopted the ancient elven cooking style that their
                father had taught them. After an “incident” with Bakren’s mother, the Rennyn boys were forced to hit the
                road, adopting the lifestyle of vagabonds. For years, they lived off only their wit and their cooking
                expertise. One day on the road Stekard and Bakren encounter a severely wounded warrior. They used a
                special medicinal recipe that their father had taught them and were able to successfully heal the
                warrior. This warrior eventually joined up with the band of misfits, and followed them on their way to
                find their new “Haven”. They have found this “Haven”, and are now settled down with the warrior who
                strangely has decided to settle with them, out of gratitude or necessity the young Rennyns may never
                know.

                They seek to provide a safe environment where people can enjoy life free of sorrow and pain, but also
                enjoy their lives with taverns, games, and magic. They also seek to support those around them through
                any means.
