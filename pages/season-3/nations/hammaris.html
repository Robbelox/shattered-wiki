            <p>
                The clans of Hammaris have long since roamed the seas and snowscapes of the world. They are experts at
                navigating the frozen waters of winter with their longboats. Despite being divided for hundreds of
                years,
                the nomadic lifestyle they once led has meant they each stuck loosely together in their travels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shatterings over the centuries have crippled societies, quaking the earth and bringing monsters
                forth.
                Thanks to their hardy nature, the clans have survived the travisties that otherwise ruined other
                nations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much like the other nations, their luck ran short with the horror of the Culling but a year ago. No
                longer
                was it simple storms to endure, but massacres from creatures unknown. The safety of the waters in the
                harsh
                times were no longer safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The individual clans of Hammaris were scattered, with no more than a handful surviving from each group.
                They
                selfishly saw this time as an opportunity to seize power from the others. It was a free for all war on
                the
                high seas, and the following months became known as the Month of the Red Sea among the surviving
                Hammarish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the bloodshed had finally ceased, those who survived saw the folly of their ways. The people agreed
                to
                meet in the southern tundras to discuss their further actions, knowing that should they fall into war
                once
                more it would be the end of all clans.
            </p>
            <p>
                After much discussion a pact was made. The pact dictated the clans would not raise blade nor bow against
                one
                another. Furthermore, they gave up their life on the waves in place of living in the snowy tundras.
                Despite
                being an extremely unpopular choice among the people, it was begrudgingly accepted. The choice was made
                in
                order to ensure they stuck together, as the remaining people would have to rely on one another in order
                to
                survive the harsh environments of the icy plains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Battered and bloodied from their turbulent history, the people of Hammaris look to restore their clans
                in a
                new home, under a new, unified flag.
