            <p>
                Kingdom of Eliseu is founded (Human, Vi)
                <br> Kingdom of Ierima is founded (Goblin, Vi, Orc)
                <br> Kingdom of Leuteuh is founded (Lizardkin)
                <br> Eliseu grows, advances in basic medicine and art
                <br> Leuteuh advances in medicine and 3D art, such as statues and architecture, in their isolation
                <br> Ierima grows much, developing a species based class divide as it expands. Vi are elite, while
                Goblins
                and Orcs are discriminated against and treated as lesser beings, despite Vi being the minority
                <br> Leuteuh grew to have the most land, and the second highest population behind Ierima
                <br> Ierima, using Orcs and Goblins as disposable warriors, wage war on Eliseu
                <br> Eliseu, desperate, goes to Leuteuh for help. Leuteuh refuses, wishing to stay separate and neutral
                <br> Ierima successfully conquers Eliseu with ease, the two kingdoms now transforming into the Vi Empire
                <br> Leuteuh, after underestimating the might of former Ierima, becomes concerned for their survival.
                Begins
                increasing defenses and military
                <br> Thinking Leuteuh is preparing for an offensive strike, the Vi Empire attacks Leuteuh, not taking
                time
                to conquer, but instead complete annihilation. Lizardkin population is driven dangerously low
                <br> Vi Empire officially becomes the strongest faction in all of Iteria, with the most land and the
                ability
                to keep it protected.
                <br> Vi Empire moves for world domination via eradication of lesser kingdoms. Severe nationalism is
                prevalent among violent Vi, though many still take after the more peaceful ways of the Eliseu Vi
                <br> On their conquest, the Vi Empire uses non-Vi as their warriors, both taking down potential
                opposition,
                and bringing competing species to more manageable numbers
                <br> Peaceful Vi, seeing the destruction of other species, begin rioting for the protection and
                preservation
                of these species and their cultures
                <br> Huge divide is formed within Vi empire, as a civil rights movement morphs into civil war
                <br> Carnage and destruction is so widespread, the massive Vi empire is brought down in a mere decade.
                <br> The innate differences in peaceful Vi and violent Vi finally grow enough for the two ways of life
                to be
                considered separate species; Villagers and Illagers
                <br> Villagers conceal their magic, and learn to fear violence in the ruins of the Vi Empire. Settle
                down in
                small towns that dot the landscape.
                <br> Illagers, who have all but lost their magic except for a small few, begin constructing new bases of
                operations and outposts, their nationalism now evolved into complete xenophobia, wish to re-conquer
                Iteria
                and completely eradicate any other species.

            <h1>The Current Era</h1>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">~ 5 000 years ago</h2>
            <p>
                Aimeth first founded
                <br> In the ruins of former kingdoms and the Vi empire, many new kingdoms rose. A warrior by the name of
                Avigdor, along with his followers, begin to conquer other kingdoms and put them under their control
                <br> Some are nervous that such displays of power would lead to another Vi Empire
                <br> Avigdor defies expectations, as his new empire, the Itosean Empire, prospers, along with all who
                reside
                in it
                <br> As the Itosean Empire grows, Avigdor is considered equivalent to a god by many, and the Ethesian
                faith
                is born, dedicated to following his precedent
                <br> The Itosean Empire falls as generations pass, its rulers forgetting the standard Avigdor had set.
                The
                Sakari Order, in charge of most of the Itosean Empire‚Äôs peacekeeping and military, survives.
                <br> Rapid growth of Aimeth
                <br> Fall of Aimeth
                <br> A mysterious creature appears and begins preaching the word of the Conqueror, a goddess that wished
                to
                judge Iteria, either granting them infinite life, resources, and space for expansion, or eradicating
                them
                completely
                <br> Many ignore the creature, though those who take his words seriously begin to refer to him as the
                Harbinger. He is hunted by those who did not want him to be able to summon this goddess, though he
                manages
                to amass a following of those who wished to help him.
                <br> The Harbinger‚Äôs group, the Gatesmen, last shortly. Their numbers small and their enemies numerous,
                they
                are all but wiped out completely. It is later restarted by a man corrupted by a magical Gatesmen
                artifact,
                but this branch no longer follows the ideals of the Harbinger or the Conqueror.
                <br> The Sect of the Fallen One, a group dedicated to resurrecting their ancient god, steals the Heart
                of
                the Forest, the item he was imprisoned in. This causes plant growth to stop, starving Iteria and killing
                off
                people by the millions
                <br> The Gatesmen were restarted by a man corrupted by a magical Gatesmen artifact
                <br> The Sect of the Fallen One steal an Illager artifact, a gateway to the realm of Frost, the End
                <br> The Heart of the Forest is recovered by its guardian, a powerful Demon, so plant growth may return
                to
                Iteria
                <br> Many of the Iterian people, driven by revenge, planned an attack on the Sect of the Fallen One.
                They
                escaped through the End‚Äôs portal, and later reformed into the empire known as Eterna
                <br> The Gatesmen leader gets corrupted by a whispering void crystal leading to his demise
                <br> The Gatesmen‚Äôs leadership changes, and the faction stops following the ideals of the Conqueror
                <br> Ender Chests lose their powers
                <br> Several gateways to the Deep Void open in the overworld, creating a larger connection between the
                two
                <br> Crystalborn creatures start invading Iteria and the land becomes corrupted
                <br> The Deep Void Gateway gets destroyed by Voldonaire's sacrifice
