            <h1>Ondor, of Highest Reach</h1>
            <p>
                The Quarti Empire was consumed in war, a time of conflict and warring peoples that lasted for hundreds
                of
                years. As provinces turned state, the once-great Empire fracturing like glass, there were those who
                wanted
                no part in it. One such group was House Ondor, one of the high houses of the Empire, who wished to spare
                the
                common man from suffering in a war driven by greed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The head of House Ondor left an open invitation, welcoming any and all regardless of sex, gender, caste,
                or
                wealth, to join them in the Anquandes. Using the mountain range as a natural barrier, the people under
                House
                Ondor‚Äôs protection managed to live relatively peaceful lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the years passed, the unnamed colony was given the name of ‚ÄúOndor‚Äù by the people, wishing to honour
                their
                saviours. As more people heard of a sanctuary among the mountains, Ondor expanded, turning from colony
                to
                two to a dozen, all under the collective name of Ondor. Every colony worked with one another, creating
                an
                intricate web of aid and trade throughout the mountains and valleys.
            </p>
            <p>
                The land itself, the mountains and the valleys, gave the people their tranquillity. In thanks, the
                Ondorans
                hold great reverence for the land itself, the very dirt upon which they tread, in stark contrast to
                their
                Quarti ancestors.
            </p>
            <p>
                For over a hundred years the Ondorans thrived in their secluded slice of the Sundered Lands, yet the
                most
                recent Shattering, twenty years ago, spelled disaster for Ondor. In the quakes, the members of House
                Ondor
                were relieved of their lives, leaving the colonies and clans disorganised and unruly. Without the order
                and
                organization of their leadership, trade routes swiftly broke down, and what could only be described as
                famine broke out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many tried and failed to unite the withering nation, but it was not until recently that any one
                individual
                has had any success. Now, the people are hopeful, as a new dawn is on the horizon.
