            The Story of the First Shattering
        </h1>
        <p>
            The ‚Äòworld that once was‚Äô has ended. In an instant, destruction reaped the land. Earthquakes and floods
            broke the land apparent and a thousand castles and towns were reduced to rubble. The once fertile continent
            of Ayka distorted and twisted into a shattering of a countless number of islands and terrains. Grotesque
            creatures of mythology, once stories to scare children, attacked the land.
        </p>
        <p>
            The social system of the civilised world that had been in place for centuries had been broken down in a
            matter of days. Those that had once been rich had their expensive villas stripped before their eyes, their
            vast swathes of farmland being scorched into cinders by the sun, and their peasants either killed or
            disappearing. Many of those peasants came back to their old owners, taking out a lifetime of anger and
            resentment. Soon, the only way to survive was to go back to their primative roots, resorting to the killing,
            raping and looting that reserved for those deemed uncivilised.
        </p>
        <p>
            The barbaric tribes of the north were the ones who benefited most from this breakdown of the natural order.
            Their lands were far from the centre of the disaster, and their warlike societies were well suited to this
            new world order, allowing them to quickly take advantage of the issues in the south. They conducted raid
            after raid into the new broken lands, taking gold, food and slaves back to their homelands in triumph. For a
            while the barbarian tribes grew into vastly wealthy kingdoms, until their hubris got the better of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            For pestilence haunted the all survivors - civilised or uncivilised. Like a demon the feared Nasyrik plague
            stalked the lands. It deformed most into a wretched race to be known as ‚Äúmutes‚Äù. These pitiful souls
            established small villages where they cowered from the nightly beasts that beset them. The lucky few who
            were not affected watched in horror as humanity was drained before their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For countless years this state of destruction continued. Yet, the cycle and the number of natural disasters
            and plagues began to wane. The few surviving sentient humans began to hope that their efforts would not be
            in vain. Given the great gift of stability, perhaps they could build strong societies. It was then that, in
            the middle of an ocean sitting upon the rocky outcrop, an intact city was spotted. It was the fortress of
            Lyrios, the once capital of the mighty Lyrian Empire. The fertile pastures that once surrounded it were no
            more but its walls stood strong and high above the waves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Word spread fast and soon all set sail. In the empty forum a great conference was assembled. The dream of
            civilisation was front and center. The discovery of Lyrios, with its temples and libraries, brought morale
            and determination. A map of the known surrounding world was pieced together, and a series of treaties and
            charters were agreed. With the symbol of Lyrios burned into their minds, the survivors stepped out into this
            new world, to conquer it for their own and establish Kingdoms once more.
