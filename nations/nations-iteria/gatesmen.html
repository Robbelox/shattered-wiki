        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The Gatesmen were founded by the Harbinger, a creature with the skin and blood of the Ender. He spoke of an
            otherworldly being known as the Conqueror and told the people of Iteria what she wanted. ‚ÄúShe wants peace
            among the realms,‚Äù he spoke, ‚ÄúIf we summon her, she will take Iteria to her realm, a land where time does
            not matter and you may live for as long as you like.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúHowever, she will only deem Iteria worthy if you are united. If conflict is no more. Otherwise, she will
            wipe out Iteria and its connected dimensions, and all of its inhabitants.‚Äù Most of Iteria did not care for
            what he had to say and simply ignored his warning. Others tried to kill him for a variety of reasons. Some
            because of his appearance as a humanoid Ender, and some because they believed him and knew that if he was
            killed, he couldn‚Äôt summon the Conqueror. But some sided with him. They were few and far between, but the
            Harbinger amassed a small following and created a group known as ‚ÄúThe Gatesmen.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            This group had bases and outposts all around Iteria for several years, but unfortunately, many fell to
            monsters and people alike. Eventually, the Gatesmen group died out, with only the Harbinger left. He tried
            to recruit more, but he could never manage to rebuild the Gatesmen.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is, until Ashari Oakenheart. Ashari was out exploring, searching to the north of Avisburg in the great
            swamps that lay there. Here is where he came across an old Gatesmen base. The base had fallen to ruin, but
            he was able to find a basement under the debris. Ashari trekked through the mucky water and found several
            items of value: two books, one belonging to a cultist that had perished in the basement, and the other
            written by the Harbinger himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was one more point of interest in that basement, however. An altar made of purpur and endstone, with
            an artifact of extraordinary rarity and potential power floating above it. When Ashari reached out to touch
            this artifact, he was given a vision of the Conqueror and decided to attempt to make his own branch of the
            Gatesmen in order to restart the organization and further their goals. In the meanwhile, he put out the goal
            to build a big capital in a 1001x1001 dug-out perimeter, which put the Gatesmen to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this endeavor, Ashari tried to fulfill a ritual with the altar but made a mistake which eventually
            caused his demise. Shortly after Ashari's death, The Harbinger retook charge of The Gatesmen, but not for
            long. When The Harbinger was cured and rechanged into Ebbe, Hundal decided to take the leadership upon
            himself as he hadn't seen Ashari in weeks. His mission became making the Gatesmen a safe haven for people in
            the situation he experienced as a child. He took Ashari's mission to build a capital and divided it into
            smaller and more enjoyable steps.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>[I] Project Evolution</h3>
        <p>
            His first plan of action was cancelling the dig and starting up the first project, Project Evolution. This
            project exists out of 3 tasks: The Cleanup, The Renovation and The Castle. The main goal of this project was
            to clean up the mess littered around and improving the already existing infrastructure.
