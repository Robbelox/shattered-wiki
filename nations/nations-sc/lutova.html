        <h1>Lutova, of Torn Heritage</h1>
        <p>
            Lutova proudly wears the crown of Quart, or so they claim. As the last of the Quarti provinces to remain
            standing following the civil war, the Lutovans consider themselves the inheritors of the Quarti throne, the
            Empireâ€™s legacy, and the continent as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            This militaristic state won not through diplomacy or negotiation, but through blood and cunning. Each and
            every rival to the throne was crushed under iron boots, or brought into the fold by chains. Effective as
            this strategy was, it left them weakened and limping.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to recover their might, the Lutovans made the hard choice of opening their borders, an act not done
            by the Quarti since the time of the Great Shattering. Promising citizenship and protection to all those who
            heeded the call, the population of Lutova nearly doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, despite the best wishes of the Lutovan government, the people they had sworn to care for were
            mistreated and abused by those who objected to the opening of the border. With riots and calls for war from
            both sides, the then-leader of Lutova made the controversial act of splitting the nation in two, gifting the
            northern lands in an attempt to save the new citizens from the leaderâ€™s own making. As such, despite the
            animosity between the two nations, the relations with the new nation of Pakaroo remain that of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            This choice, whether right or wrong, proved too unpopular among the people, and the leader was pressured to
            forfeit their position. In their place, a new leader takes the throne, and has to deal with the growing
            tensions of a still rebuilding nation.
