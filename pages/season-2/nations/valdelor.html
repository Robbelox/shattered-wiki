                The Kingdom of Valdelor
            </h1>
            <p>
                The survivor's descendant's had split up into groups, 3 of which settled, while one kept on travelling
                and exploring the world. One of the groups that settled were the Valdelorians. They settled on the
                southern continent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their first leader, King Elrond, was said to be a direct descendant of the survivors. This did, However,
                not stop his people from plotting a revolution against him, for they hated monarchs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kingâ€™s head rolled, and with him fell the last real monarchy of Valdelor. However, the troubles did
                not stop there. Over the years many Governments failed, and were replaced. This went on until the
                kingdom finally fell apart, into many small states and counties. The population quickly realised that
                this was not an ideal situation, but were unable to do anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, Arthur of Benton appeared. He was a great public speaker, and managed to get the majority of
                the people of the Valdelor onto his side. The leaders of the States and counties were eventually forced
                to get together, and a pact was created.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freshly United Kingdom Valdelor was reborn. In this State, the leaders of the individual states
                became governors and were given the ability to rule freely over their land, with the only limitations
                being taxes and Arthurâ€™s Orders.
