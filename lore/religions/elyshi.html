            <h1>Elyshi</h1>

            <p>The <strong>Elyshi</strong> is a structured and expanding religion with a focus on creating detailed
                spiritual practices and constructing awe-inspiring monuments across the world. Its mission centers on
                growth, the enrichment of its traditions, and the beautification of the lands through its sacred
                structures.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchy and Ranks</h2>

            <p>The Elyshi religion operates through a hierarchical system comprising five distinct ranks:
                <strong>Disciple</strong>, <strong>Priest</strong>, <strong>High Priest</strong>, <strong>Head
                    Priest</strong>, and <strong>Apostle</strong>. Each rank carries unique roles and responsibilities,
                although all members contribute to the construction and resource gathering necessary for Temples and
                High Temples.
            </p>

            <h2>Disciples</h2>
            <p>Disciples are the entry-level followers of the Elyshi faith. Their primary duty is to respond to calls
                from Head Priests or higher-ranking officials, typically for significant events such as religious wars
                or grand ceremonies. Beyond this, they are expected to avoid worshipping other deities.</p>

            <h2>Priests</h2>
            <p>At the rank of Priest, members begin taking an active role in the faith. Priests are compensated with one
                coin for every person they successfully bring into the religion. Additional rewards, including coins or
                diamonds, can be earned by completing tasks listed on the task board or by participating in temple
                construction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Altar Building:</strong> Priests can construct altars (minimum size: 5√ó5√ó5) for a reward of
                    one coin. These altars must be built using prismarine and gold, and the reward is granted only once.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Priests must also participate in holy wars and receive a personalized staff as a symbol of their
                position.</p>

            <h2>High Priests</h2>
            <p>High Priests retain the duties of Priests but gain additional privileges. They are tasked with building
                larger temples (minimum size: 20√ó20√ó30), which earn five coins upon approval from a Head Priest or
                Apostle. Temples must honor specific deities and adhere to detailed designs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High Priests are invited to participate in High Council meetings, where they may propose new ideas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>They receive an upgraded staff and a formal ceremony to mark their elevation.</p>

            <h2>Head Priests</h2>
            <p>Head Priests oversee the activities of High Priests and carry greater responsibilities. They are
                authorized to supervise the construction of <strong>Grand Temples</strong> (minimum size: 80√ó80√ó80),
                which are themed around specific gods and require prior approval in council meetings. Successfully
                overseeing a Grand Temple project qualifies a Head Priest for potential promotion to Apostle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Head Priests are also required to attend weekly council meetings and must provide valid reasons for
                    any absences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They are awarded high-tier ceremonial staff and robes, along with a grand ceremony at a completed Grand
                Temple. Misuse of power by a Head Priest results in branding as a <strong>Traitor</strong>, with
                execution mandated.</p>

            <h2>Apostles</h2>
            <p>Apostles represent the highest rank within the Elyshi hierarchy. To ascend to this position, a candidate
                must meet specific criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully oversee the construction of a Grand Temple or an equivalent project.</li>
                <li>Maintain regular activity within the community.</li>
                <li>Contribute to the religion beyond temple construction.</li>
                <li>Hold the rank of Head Priest.</li>
                <li>Recruit at least three new members.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate is celebrated in a ceremony with mandatory
                attendance by all Priests and higher ranks. Apostles are granted a personalized staff, their likeness
                displayed in the Chamber of Apostles, and a unique title. They are also empowered to approve High Priest
                promotions. Misconduct by an Apostle results in branding as a <strong>Traitor</strong> and immediate
                execution.</p>
