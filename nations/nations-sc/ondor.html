        <h1>Ondor, of Highest Reach</h1>
        <p>
            The Quarti Empire was consumed in war, a time of conflict and warring peoples that lasted for hundreds of
            years. As provinces turned state, the once-great Empire fracturing like glass, there were those who wanted
            no part in it. One such group was House Ondor, one of the high houses of the Empire, who wished to spare the
            common man from suffering in a war driven by greed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The head of House Ondor left an open invitation, welcoming any and all regardless of sex, gender, caste, or
            wealth, to join them in the Anquandes. Using the mountain range as a natural barrier, the people under House
            Ondor‚Äôs protection managed to live relatively peaceful lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the years passed, the unnamed colony was given the name of ‚ÄúOndor‚Äù by the people, wishing to honour their
            saviours. As more people heard of a sanctuary among the mountains, Ondor expanded, turning from colony to
            two to a dozen, all under the collective name of Ondor. Every colony worked with one another, creating an
            intricate web of aid and trade throughout the mountains and valleys.
        </p>
        <p>
            The land itself, the mountains and the valleys, gave the people their tranquillity. In thanks, the Ondorans
            hold great reverence for the land itself, the very dirt upon which they tread, in stark contrast to their
            Quarti ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>
            For over a hundred years the Ondorans thrived in their secluded slice of the Sundered Lands, yet the most
            recent Shattering, twenty years ago, spelled disaster for Ondor. In the quakes, the members of House Ondor
            were relieved of their lives, leaving the colonies and clans disorganised and unruly. Without the order and
            organization of their leadership, trade routes swiftly broke down, and what could only be described as
            famine broke out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many tried and failed to unite the withering nation, but it was not until recently that any one individual
            has had any success. Now, the people are hopeful, as a new dawn is on the horizon.
