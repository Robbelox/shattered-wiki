        <h1>Mara, of New Foundations</h1>
        <p>
            Newcomers to the Sundered Lands, the Mari people only arrived on the continent a mere thirteen years ago,
            and
            made quick work establishing themselves as one of the great powers of the continent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally from distant lands, the people of Mara were victims of an all too common tale; that of the
            Shattering. Their home ruined, the survivors vowed to travel to a land untouched by ruin, that of the Quarti
            Empire. The great pilgrimage was a struggle among the people, the large population leaving their pace at a
            crawl. In order to keep supplies and provisions high, the Mari people pillaged and raided all they stumbled
            across.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite these violent actions, the Mari peopleâ€™s heritage was one of relative peace. Their powerful military
            might, and policy of only taking what is needed from their enemies, left Mara with a reputation of a
            peaceful
            giant. Safe, so long as they are happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their distance and temporary nomadic ways meant that news of the world at large was slow to reach them, so
            one
            could understand their surprise that upon arriving at the border of Quart, they were not met with a mighty,
            united Empire, but a war torn land of blood and steel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not afraid of utilizing their military prowess, Mara wiped the local states off the map, taking their
            resources
            to build themselves a new home. Content with the land and supplies they had secured, Mara returned to her
            once
            peaceful ways, supposedly without issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, bloodlust boils beneath the surface. The younger generation, born in the later days of the pilgrimage,
            have
            known nothing but pillaging and violence all their lives, and call for Mara to turn to a path of conquest.
            Unable to cope with the stress of an uneasy people, someone new now sits on the throne, and it falls to them
            to
            guide their people down the road to peace, or the road to war.
        </p>
