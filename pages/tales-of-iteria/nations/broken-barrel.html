            <p>
                The Broken Barrel was formed by 3 brothers Uldren, Terrowin, and Berry. These 3 brothers are from the
                far
                away land of Scotica where drinking and alcohol are an important part of the culture. When the 3
                brothers
                grew older they decided to go adventuring and make a new life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually the 3 brothers ended up in Iteria, a foreign country, and they decided to settle down for a
                bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 3 brothers are currently setting up a tavern called ‚Äúthe broken barrel‚Äù in an attempt to try to
                bring a
                bit of their culture over to Iteria.
