        <h1>
            History
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Bast√¶rni people are an example of a highly tribalised society, and the benefits and downsides that come
            with it. They live in the vast forest lands of the south, leaving only to trade with foreign people for
            foreign goods. Throughout history, they have been highly insular, keeping to themselves and only conducting
            raids on those that stray too close to the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within their society, the Bast√¶rni are split into hundreds of petty kings of a tribe, or even just a portion
            of such. This highly decentralised system means that wars between the various tribes are rampant, and when
            combined with their highly warlike attitude, meant that there was little time to fight others between wars
            among themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, they have united a few times in history, mostly under a strong leader and in the event of a large
            foreign invader. These kings who have managed to unite the scattered people have been known to history as
            hard, strong, but brutal leaders who would do anything to make their plans work. Although, this unity never
            lasted more than a generation. With the death of the king, the tribes would regain their autonomy and
            restart the infighting. The only two tribes who have done this, the Osterwalde and the Suaring people, were
            hated enemies and blood rivals. The two people had hated each other for eternity, their rivalry starting
            with two mythical founders of each tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, the foreigners from the north started to set up colonies on the northern coast. The Bast√¶rni have
            had a complicated relationship with them, alternating between ransacking their forts and cities, or simply
            trading for foreign goods. It is through these trade goods that the Bast√¶rni people have been exposed to the
            rest of the world, allowing them to trade their lucrative fur trade in exchange for valuable goods from
            across the seas, including silks, dyes and metals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Achaean and Tiberians have been known to finance and equip the tribes, putting them against one another,
            helping to reignite tensions at every opportunity. However, despite their attempts, neither culture has
            managed to conquer the southern forests. Every excursion into the Bast√¶rni land has resulted in crippling
            defeats at the hands of talented raiders, or left with a desolate land without food and cut off from their
            supply route. As such, the Bast√¶rni have retained their independence throughout history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Shattering arrived late for the Bast√¶rni, due to their relative isolation from the rest of the continent
            and the Empire system. However, when it arrived, it hit them hard. The people had little to no resistance to
            the multitude of plagues that regularly ravished the Tiberian Empire and the surrounding nations, and as
            such, their immune system was poor. Entire tribes ceased to exist, as the people fled from coastal areas and
            towards the deep south that bore their heartland, serving only to spread it further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, a few tribal kings managed to implement systems to combat the plague, which mostly referred to
            killing those who were infected, and keeping their bodies in isolation from the rest of the tribe. In doing
            so, they managed to absorb the remaining tribes that had become leaderless.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new kings stayed in the south for many years, before the plague had finally subsided, the survivors
            either gaining an immunity to what remained. However, this plague came at an even higher price. The forests
            of the north had all but been destroyed by the divine disasters that accompanied the Shattering.
            Nonetheless, the climate had changed, and they were forced from their southern homes and back to the north,
            which was now desolate of human life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two kingdoms have risen within the Bast√¶rni continent, the once rival kings of the Suaring and the
            Osterwalde. They have settled onto the northern coasts, and now look outward for the first time in history,
            to the rest of the world to take part in their deadly rivalry. Will they civilise into a feudal system like
            the other kingdoms? Or will they return to their native tribal roots?

                    Osterwalde
                </h2>
                <p style="padding: 0 5%;">
                    The Osterwalde clan originated with the legendary king Walde, who claimed descent from the earth god
                    himself. Songs are told about how he managed to wrestle a mountain lion sent (by a jealous goddess
                    that he had rejected) to kill his kinsmen, eventually slaying it and taking its pelt as a trophy. As
                    such, the Osterwalde people present the lion on their banner to commemorate this great victory over
                    the gods, and to show the strength and prestige that runs through their veins.

                </h2>
                <p style="padding: 0 5%;">
                    The Suaring clan is descended from the legendary king Suara, who claimed descent from the god of the
                    rivers. Suara is known not only as the first king of the Suaring people, but also as the figure who
                    challenged a god to a bet. He believed himself to be the best swimmer, the one who could hold his
                    breath the longest, and as the best fisherman in the world. The god of the local river with the form
                    of a turtle, however, became offended by his huge pride, and challenged him to a bet. If Suara won,
                    he would be given the finest woman in the world. But if Suara lost, he would drown in the river. The
                    two of them fought hard, taking weeks for each challenge. But, in the end, Suara won, and won
                    against the river god, and went on to create the famous Suaring clan.

        <h2>
            Unification
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the Varian-Prythonian "war", King Auduin looked to Osterwalde neighbor, the Suaring. He looked on them
            as he once looked on the Osterwalde during the "Swift panic". With the help of an advisor he created a pan
            Bast√¶rnian university, and plans for several cities to be shared between the nations. Eventually Queen Mara
            of the Suaring met with King Auduin of Osterwalde to hammer out plans for new nation. Unlike many people
            thought this would not happen through one nation conquering the other, but through the creation of a brand
            new kingdom. During the joining ceremony for this nation the the earth God appeared behind the 2 monarchs,
            he was angry that these two nations were joining peacefully, and he demanded blood. King Auduin called his
            advisor, a land owner named √Üthelstan. √Üthelstan shook the Earth gods with an expression of regret, yet also
            happiness that his idea was coming together, the earth god reached for his axe, but found it missing from
            it's hilt. √Üthelstan then yelled "for Bast√¶rnia" as King Auduin struck √Üthelstan using the gods axe. But not
            for the head like the earth god intended, Auduin instead chopped off √Üthelstan's right hand and stated that
            "This is the only blood that will be spilt for Bast√¶rnia". And thus Auduin was proclaimed Kaiser of the
            Basternian Empire, and √Üthelstan became his right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kaiser Auduin had taken the more civilized characteristics and combined them with the tribal values to
            create The Bast√¶rnian Empire. Organizing the empire into states, which each have their own leaders, and a
            level of autonomy. Under this new empire, Auduin had secured the future for the Bast√¶rni people.

            √Ümocism
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other
            beings, such as humanity and the j√∂tnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes or family members of the
            gods. The cosmos in Bast√¶rni mythology consists of Seven Worlds that flank a central tree, L√¶ra√∞r. Units of
            time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The source texts mention numerous gods, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="centered">
            <li>The battle-axe-wielding, humanity-protecting earth god Aemok, who relentlessly fights his foes;</li>
            <li>His son, Loki, who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the
                runic alphabet;</li>
            <li>The beautiful, feathered cloak-clad goddess who rides to battle to choose among the slain;</li>
            <li>The vengeful, hunting goddess, who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore;</li>
            <li>The god whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity;</li>
            <li>The widowed goddess, who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Elyshi
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Elyshi are a Sect of √Ümocism beginning in the South east of Basternia. They believe in the traditional
            pantheon of √Ümocism with a stronger value of Loki and greater worship.

        <h2>
            Literacy
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is rare for the Bast√¶rnians people to be educated, most are born into poor, working families, so they
            learn trade over education. This differs for those with more riches, but those still have basic education in
            comparison with some other nations. Instead of brains, most make up for it in brawn and learn more of
            fighting and working hard than any other kingdom.
