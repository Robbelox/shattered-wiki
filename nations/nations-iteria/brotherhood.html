        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The Brotherhood, formerly known as just "The Brothers," was founded a long time ago but was unfortunately
            disbanded a few years later because of different beliefs among the group. It was later revived by Andrew
            Gustav. The Brotherhood was known for their thievery and incredibly experienced assassins. The goal of the
            faction was to steal valuables from other factions. But maybe their goals have changed? Maybe their goals
            have become more pure-hearted, or maybe they've become worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original founders, Von Herdies and Scelles Reignfold, were said to be excellent duelists. Some said that
            they had won over five hundred battles, while others claimed they hadn't even won one hundred. The two
            founders were found mysteriously dead just a few years later.
