                    <p>
                        Æthelstan was born to a small farming family in the Bastærni lands. Throughout the ages His
                        family had attended to this small farming estate, tending to crops, trading those crops to
                        whoever controlled the land at the time (which changed frequently) and becoming victim to
                        several raids from rival Tribes (which happened even more frequently). Despite this, he
                        seemed to have a tongue of silver and could talk his way out of most situations. Many times he
                        was
                        a mediator between the tribes, settling uneasy peace. For a while Æthelstan had aspirations like
                        most low born boys his age: to become a knight, fight great battles, and earn glory and gold.
                        His
                        uncle Alfrid had done the same when he was but a baby, and when he visited his brother
                        Æthelstead he told the best stories. Later Æthelstan grew out of his aspirations of becoming a
                        knight when his father's health began to wane, he'd take his father's position for him. The
                        Shattering hit hard. His father, whose health was already failing, became victim to one of the
                        great plagues. His mother was bedridden for weeks on end, and no matter how hard Æthelstan tried
                        to care for her she only got worse. Then young Æthelstan contracted it too, and he thought that
                        he too would perish in the midst of this plague. He pushed through and came out on the other
                        side with interesting news. In all the chaos, some local Bastærni tribes united to form the
                        kingdom of Osterwalde. Æthelstan pledged his allegiance to the reigning monarch and began the
                        task of rebuilding his once great estate, realizing that most other farms had been destroyed.

                    <p>
                        Arne grew up in a rural area with his mother and father and 3 brothers. His dad was a
                        hunter/fighter, which led to his death when Arne was 11. His dad thought them basic things like
                        how to shoot a bow, use a sword, ride a horse etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arne is not much of an architect but is good with his hands. He worked on a small farm for a
                        number of years and was then hired in a mine full-time so he could pay family rent. Their only
                        food was wheat, potatoes, carrots and beef (from the few
                        cows they owned).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day in the middle of the night an unknown group of armoured men came to
                        their house posing as the land owner and that they wanted rent. Arne explained that he just
                        payed the rent and cant afford to pay it again, so the men killed their cows and burned their
                        crops and house killing the youngest brother. They fled when the other villagers came to help
                        the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the morning arne started to look for a new settlement. They tried to travel far
                        away north to hide from the unknown men. After many weeks of searching, his 2 remaining brothers
                        died of hunger and flu. Eventually Arne reached snow. They had infinite water by melting the
                        snow and they were happy. But when they went to sleep, the fire burned out faster than expected
                        and Arne's
                        mother froze to death. Arne was scared and heartbroken so he ran as far and as fast as he could.
                        The next night while looking for a settlement, a pack of wolves spotted Arne so he ran and hid
                        in a cave. He woke up fine the next morning to a group of men, armoured, but not like the
                        "unknown men". They helped him up and brought him out of the cave. He turned around to see a
                        settlement known as Kurgan.

                    <p>
                        Hailing from the prestigious cadet dynasty of the illustrious Tiberians, the Varians are known
                        as one of the most powerful families in the old Empire. Ruling from the city of Vara, they have
                        considerable influence within all branches of government, especially within political and
                        military affairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aurelius was born as a second son to the head of the Varian line, Septimus Vara. Known as a
                        cruel man whose ambitions knew no bounds, and even some rumoured plans to lead a coup against
                        the current Emperor to usurp the throne. As a second son, Aurelius was always treated as a
                        ‘spare’ rather than the ‘heir’. He hardly ever saw his parents, who devoted much of their free
                        time to the eldest son, leaving Aurelius with the servants. Aurelius developed a hatred for his
                        family, and often took to sneaking away from the palace at night, spending the nights in the
                        poor districts of Vara with a gang of children his age, taking part in petty theft and mischief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he was discovered sneaking out at night by his father, he was banished from the city and
                        sent to an academy on the mountainous northern border. It was clear the direction his life would
                        take, as devised by his father. A life in the military, bolstering the Varian line by bringing
                        glory to the house, as well as influence within the army, all to improve his brother’s position.
                        The academy treated their students harshly in a militaristic fashion, making the developing boys
                        wake before dawn, study for hours each day, and finish daunting chores. Living in the desolate
                        mountain side was extremely tough, with extremely cold winters, little food, and backbreaking
                        work. Many students couldn’t cope with the new way of life, and by the end of the first season,
                        only half of the year remained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the hardships he faced, Aurelius continued to survive the work, pushed forwards by his
                        intense hatred of his family and determined to prove them wrong. He excelled under the
                        circumstances, gaining top marks in both classroom academics and physical classes, quickly
                        mastering horse riding and duelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he reached his name day, becoming a man, he was granted leave to travel to Vara, and choose
                        a deity for himself, to watch over and grant him strength. For Aurelius, there was only one
                        choice. He scaled the high staircase leading to the most glorious temple in the city, passing
                        the crippled priests of the goddess, and kneeled down before her altar. He chose the Goddess of
                        War, Beluna as his patron saint, devoting himself to her worship until the end of his days. To
                        seal the pact, he pulled out a knife and marked his face, causing long streams of blood to flow
                        down past his eyes. Despite the intense pain, he did not flinch, the goddess’ power giving him
                        the strength to push past any discomfort. When he rose, he was a different person to before. Now
                        he was a man, with a new aura of strength. With the goddess’ blessing, his destiny had been
                        altered forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few nights later, Aurelius was awoken by the world suddenly shaking. He jumped out of bed,
                        running to the window, just to see the world moving from side to side from some unknown reason.
                        As the shaking grew more violent, screams started to be heard through the darkness, and
                        buildings started to fall, their foundation broken. He ran from the academy along with a few
                        other younger boys, and they hid in the woods, surviving only off of things they could find or
                        catch. However, he knew this couldn’t last. Some day they would have to return. And so, a month
                        later, they ventured out into the world again. When he reached the nearest town, it was empty of
                        life. Only ruins remained of what had once been a prosperous town. It was the same with every
                        town they came across, with only gangs of bandits appearing out of the shadows to loot anything
                        of value from the survivors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he finally returned to his home city of Vara, it was no different. Not even one of the
                        greatest cities on the continent could withstand the natural disasters that plagued the empire.
                        It was a shadow of what it once was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally turning his back to the lands of the past, he returned to the mountains, collecting
                        survivors along the way. The land was harsh, and survival hard, but they managed to continue.
                        His leadership saved the lives of many, and he was soon elected as king of what remained of the
                        Varian people. Thankfully, due to its isolation, they escaped the worst of the resulting
                        pandemic that plagued the lands over the next few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now he returns from the highlands, bringing with him the toughest people of the greatest culture
                        known to man. Will he establish an Empire to rival the Tiberians? Or will he fall to some
                        foreign invader like so many have? Only time will tell.

                        As a young boy, Cedric fought to survive. His father was a warrior, and so he was taken into the
                        warbands as a child, despite the harsh life. He lost his father young, but fortunately he was
                        well liked, and the men kept him around, feeding him scraps. The lack of food, the cold weather,
                        the long distances to march, they all added up on the growing boy’s development. He would either
                        grow up weak, or stronger than ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 16, he finally underwent the warrior’s rites, becoming a man in the eyes of the
                        Galatai. He was finally able to take part in a raid himself, and to win glory and wealth. They
                        were planning to attack an isolated Kurgan village in the borderlands between the two nations,
                        an easy raid that would slowly bring him into the society. Or so they thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They attacked at night, their longbows drawn as they edged closer to the town, hiding behind
                        trees and avoiding the lights. Then came the screams. Men disappeared into the darkness, their
                        lives suddenly extinguished. It had been a trap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The raid leader had been one of the first to die, an axe flung expertly into his skull, killing
                        him instantly. The raid fell into disarray. There was no longer a leader, and they started
                        panicking, firing arrows blindly into the treeline in the hopes of landing a lucky shot, but
                        instead only bringing on another onslaught of Kurgan. They were surrounded. Cedric had to make a
                        choice; surrender, or fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He raised his voice, before shouting at the top of his lungs, ordering the men to form a skein
                        formation, and to advance deeper into the woods, to force their way through the Kurgan lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warband lost half their men, including their leader, but escaped total defeat. In
                        recognition of his efforts, he was unanimously elected as the next leader of the warband.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Word spread of his deeds, as he led the warband to victory after victory, bringing back plunder,
                        slaves, and most importantly, prestige. When the Shattering came, people followed him. He
                        managed to save many people from the onslaught of sicknesses that plagued Prythonia by leading
                        them into the snowy wastelands, his years of experience allowing them to survive in the desolate
                        place. When he emerged, he was not a leader, but a King. The new, and only king of Prythonia.

                    <p>
                        Conan was born into the poor side of a very wealthy city. He was taught at a very young age
                        not to oppose the rich. He disagreed with this rule. When at the age of 17, Conan found some
                        likeminded individuals who called themselves "liberators", and they wanted to bring balance to
                        the city's economic climate. "In this way, none will be rich or poor", they said. Conan was
                        skeptical, but also eager to leave his certain life of poverty and servitude. So, he threw away
                        all signs of his past and said, "Show me how.".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These "liberators" would eventually turn out to be a group of terrorists with the intent to
                        overthrow the city's government. These terrorists were primarily made up of orphans and people
                        of severe poverty, though the driving force behind them were the betrayed soldiers from the
                        city's forgotten regimes. Soldiers that outlived their usefulness and were deemed unfit for duty
                        after receiving too many injuries or becoming too old. Conan was amongst the poor, and so he
                        resented the city's hierarchy, thus allying himself with these rebels. But he was only one of
                        many, as he and the other followers beside him learned how to fight without fighting, how to
                        strike from the shadows and avoid all conflict; to kill unseen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the ages of 17 to 22, he honed these skills as an assassin and alchemist, learning all
                        sorts of things about how one man could take on an entire patrol of well-armed knights. He was
                        one of the few to survive and be deemed a master. Before he could really turn these skills
                        toward the hierarchy, the Shattering came and destroyed everything. The hierarchy was destroyed,
                        but so too were Conan's friends... his family. He was the sole survivor of the chaos.
                        Whoever managed to escape the city's ruin would be killed in the aftermath. Conan, however,
                        survived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He bided his time, not knowing how many years had passed while surviving in the wilderness to
                        the north. He had never been in any kind of forestation before but was told what to expect by
                        his terrorist brethren. Using his skills as an assassin and alchemist, he survived by gathering
                        any food, materials and reagents he could find. He learned never to build a home or try to find
                        shelter, since it would merely trap you beneath the feet of a hoard of monsters and insane
                        barbarians. He learned to hunt during the day and hide up in the trees at night. He learned to
                        survive alone, without assistance from his fellow assassins and alchemists. He learned the price
                        and the benefits of solitude and anti-socialism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, here he was, years later and still in the northern forests, surviving. Nothing changed
                        until the day a scouting party of Prythonians set upon him. He easily hid from their sight,
                        having seen them from far away. He was nearly ready to kill them all based on shear instinct
                        when he suddenly awoke from his barbaric post-apocalyptic slumber and realized, “These are real
                        people!” he thought to himself. So, he quickly got a look at their clothing and made the
                        summation that they were some form of nation, due to the markings and symbols on their
                        equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan managed to follow them for a few minutes, and as luck would have it, one of their
                        members called for a halt. “Let me have another look at the map for a moment.” their leader
                        said. Conan capitalized on this event and moved in. As they stared at their leader in front
                        of them, dismounting and taking a rest from riding their horses, Conan managed to steal a
                        Prythonian flag from one of the horses’ side-pouches. He then backed away, hiding behind some
                        brush while he worked to make the flag look dingy and torn. He tore it in small, believable
                        ways. He rubbed it against the ground in a rough scraping pattern. The flag began to look almost
                        as dingy as Conan did, after all those years hiding in the northern forests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as the scouting party was to resume their travels, Conan came out in front of them from
                        a nearby bush, holding the flag over his shoulder. In the condition he was in after all these
                        years in the forest, his clothing was unrecognizable, looking more like pieces of dirty wool or
                        parchment. The Prythonian’s first aimed their bows before seeing the flag strung over his
                        shoulder, easily blending with his torn and battered attire. They quickly lowered their weapons
                        and questioned him. As an assassin, Conan found it very easy to utilize practiced universal
                        lies. All he had to do was exchange a few words here and there that gave specific information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan spun a tale about how he had lost his way a couple of weeks ago. He claimed to be a
                        Prythonian and was captured by some barbarians but escaped. As a trained assassin, part of his
                        skillset was learning to practice rehearsed universal lies. Lies that apply to multiple
                        situations and can be used anywhere, if a few select words are exchanged to fit the situation at
                        hand. Using these skills, Conan managed to fool the scouting party and they gladly took him
                        back with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan was finally out of the wilderness and into civilization once more. He was still very
                        unused to speaking to people after all this time, but he had been practicing keeping his social
                        skills for a day just like this. At first, he made an awkward integration into Prythonia, but he
                        managed to fit in after some weeks passed. It was difficult to keep lying, since nobody
                        recognized him, and he had to keep pretending that he was “forgetting” all their customs and
                        daily rituals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually though, he was found out by the King of Prythonia himself, Cedric. This king
                        apparently knew all his subjects, and Conan was not one of them. The moment he looked upon
                        Conan, he knew something was wrong. Conan, not even getting a moment to say anything,
                        was suddenly set-upon by Cedric’s warriors. Conan quickly became ready to fight, but just
                        before the conflict began, the barbarians Conan had become accustomed to fighting suddenly
                        emerged, attacking from all sides in the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conan managed to prove himself in battle. He fought differently than the Prythonians do. He
                        fought in ways that were cunning and efficient. He evaded most direct conflict and sought out
                        ways to assist his allies. He quickly became a boon in the battle, wielding his Emerald Axe and
                        the occasional potion, he turned the tide of battle and saved many lives that day. The King
                        Cedric look upon Conan a second time, and did not see a Prythonian, but an ally,
                        nonetheless.

                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <p>In his prime, Ebbe is 5'4 in height, and has long floppy ears that start near his scalp on each
                        side, just above where a normal humans ears would be. Unlike normal piglins, Ebbe's skull isn't
                        as wide, and his eye sockets aren't as round. This is due to only being half piglin, and being
                        what Ebbe had dubbed a "Pig-Man." His skin is a light brown, similar to the colour of dried
                        dirt. Physically, Ebbe is 96 years old, which is considered early middle aged or late young
                        adult for piglins. Ebbe also has two tusks coming from the sides of his mouth at an angle. Each
                        are 6 ¼ centimetres long.</p>
                    <h1>Story</h1>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not much is publicly known about Ebbe's history, but it is known he was once a great warrior and
                        leader of the piglins in a large conflict, but fled after the war. After appearing in the
                        Overworld roughly 75 years before The Shattering first begun, he could not survive in the
                        foreign realm. He wandered about the world aimlessly, avoiding towns when possible to avoid
                        conflict, slowly picking up different skills, such as foraging, hunting, reading, writing,
                        speaking, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the Shattering hit, Ebbe was forced to constantly be on the move. The world, now broken and
                        riddled with monsters just like him, there were now people who would actively seek to hunt them
                        down and kill them. Even if Ebbe tried to speak and plea with one of the humans, it only made
                        them see Ebbe as a bigger monster in their eyes. It was not until early 2020 Ebbe met Haraldr of
                        Uthon and Einar. These two proved to be great friends to Ebbe, as it was them who made Ebbe feel
                        accepted for the first time in over a century. It would be these three who created the Kurgan
                        mining town of Braka Hellir, and Einar and Ebbe would go on to become the owners of the town.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Ebbe's Undead Journey
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When Ebbe first arrived in the Overworld, much of his flesh rotted away, as well as his right
                        eye. Normally, when this happens to a piglin, they lose all sense of individuality as their
                        minds rot away with the flesh. However, this did not happen to Ebbe, and his consciousness
                        remained intact after death. For years, Ebbe simply accepted his new way of life. Half dead and
                        running. When Ebbe joined the Kurgan Kingdom, he began to acquire more and more wealth, and as
                        his wealth grew, as did his dreams. Ebbe would spend hours researching and experimenting, trying
                        everything he could to succeed in his goal, and by the thirty-first of August, Ebbe had
                        successfully revived himself to the form he was in when he died. However, the time between was
                        horrible for Ebbe. He lived in constant pain, often drinking to both forget his past and the
                        pain. The Pig-Man would also have episodes where the undead half would gain dominance, often
                        resulting in the injury of himself and/or others.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Ebbe's Later Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        After serving alongside the Kurgan Kingdom for most of his time in the Overworld, Ebbe
                        eventually left the Kurgans to become a nomadic traveler and trader. He travelled alongside his
                        two dogs, Aurum and Argentum, as well as his mule Carbon. He went on to be a well known merchant
                        across the lands, though despite being well known and accepted, he began to wear his mask and
                        hood again, completely obscuring his face and head. Ebbe would set up camps across the world,
                        often staying at them for months at a time before packing up and moving. He would always find
                        his way back to Kurgan, however, where he would leave offerings at the tomb of Haraldr, visit
                        the horses Flu, Steel, and Bronze, belonging to Ebbe, Einar, and Haraldr respectively, as well
                        as his fox Snær. Eventually, after roughly 90 years of travelling, Ebbe stopped showing up
                        around the kingdoms. Some who he had befriended sent out search parties for him, but all were
                        unsuccessful. Some began to suspect he had killed himself out of the sorrow from some of his
                        best friends perishing, either in battle, or simply natural causes. Eventually, after about a
                        year of searching, someone had happened to stopped on a small island south of Kurgan to spend
                        the night on. This island was where they found an orange eye impaled on a small tree branch. Due
                        to the proximity to Kurgan, as well as how ridiculously rare orange eyes were, Ebbe was assumed
                        dead.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Gear and Gear Preferences</h1>
                    <h2>Weapons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ebbe has been known to wield a verity of gear, constantly circulating what's in use. Despite
                        that, he has been known to use a seemingly iron broadsword, with a bejeweled golden hilt and
                        grip, known as Loki's Gift. He also uses an ordinary, though enchanted bow, called Villieldr.
                        There is one weapon he is almost never seen without, however, which are his bloodied netherite
                        gauntlets.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Armour</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Ebbe normally circulates diamond armour, he has been known to own a full set of netherite
                        armour, with two pairs of boots. He also wears the defensive arm mounted shield, traditionally
                        worn by Piglin Brutes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Gear Preferences</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite many piglins prefering broadswords and crossbows, Ebbe often prefers rapiers and hunting
                        bows, for they're more precise weapons, as well as speedier. Ebbe also prefers to where no
                        armour if possible, but will usually where diamond armour for protection.

                    <p>
                        Before the Shattering, Einar was the chieftain of the small Kurgan clan of Bjørneskog. The chaos
                        brought upon the world by the Shattering was seen as an opportunity by Einar’s clan, who took it
                        upon themselves to grow rich by raiding and pillaging the coastal villages of the Southern Sea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In preparation for each raid, Einar would go into the forest with his wife Yrsa. As his
                        forefathers had for generations, Einar and Yrsa would perform the ritual killing of a bear in
                        honor of the gods, proving themselves capable warriors in their eyes, and thereby receiving
                        their blessing and protection in the coming excursion. In exchange, the clan of Bjørneskog would
                        throw one “Tenth” of their loot overboard as payment to the gods on each return trip back home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, with the ever-growing size of the clan’s pillaged haul, so too did Einar's greed grow.
                        On the return from his most successful raiding trip, Einar failed to throw the “Tenth”
                        overboard, not bearing to see the small fortune sink into the frigid black ocean waters--a
                        decision he would regret for the rest of his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon after returning Einar and Yrsa went into the Black Woods for their ritual hunt in
                        preparation for the clan’s next raid. However, this time they would not be met with success. In
                        the night, a Dire Bear, a gruesome beast of monstrous size attacked Einar and Yrsa. In the
                        ambush, the Dire Bear slashed Einar’s face, ripping it apart and knocking him out. When he
                        finally woke, Einar found what little remained of Yrsa’s body. After burying her, he returned to
                        Bjørneskog. Even before arriving to the village he could smell it. The hoard they had brought
                        back with them from their previous raid must have been carrying a virulent plague which had
                        wiped out his entire clan in the few weeks he had spent away. The entire population of
                        Bjørneskog had been reduced to a pile of rotting corpses. In this way, Einar learned that one
                        does not slight the gods and get away with it. Too afraid to touch anything in the village,
                        Einar left everything he ever knew or had behind, and he started walking North, seeking the
                        forgiveness of the gods.

                    <p>
                        Long before the Shattering, Haraldr was first and foremost a blacksmith. His mother and father
                        brought him up on the craft, and that's where he stuck. He spent many hours forging weapons,
                        tools and metal work for his community. He was well known for his patterned steel axes, and even
                        made a few for the King's guards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As seasonal raids turned to monthly raids, Haraldr was forced to step up and take a leading role
                        in battles. His name was well recognised in his tribe and many others. If the king didn't know
                        him by his axes, he’d know him from his fighting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Shattering was a blow to all life, and to the Kurgans, it was a matter of survival of the
                        fittest. Many fights broke out between the tribes and the King was finding it difficult to
                        instill order. He thought it best to continue raids on those kingdoms which the plague had
                        already ravaged, easy pickings he thought, but in the end it came back to bite him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haraldr led many warbands into the depths of the Galatai borders, crossing into unknown
                        territory and hopefully into wealthy lands. He was soon named Jarl, and overthrew the previous
                        man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the plague started spreading through the Kurgan lands, via slave and gold, the king stood
                        still and feared for his dying people. His advisor, and Shaman to the many tribes, announced the
                        Gods had forsaken them, and that they were set for demise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haraldr defied the words of the king to stay and die, and vowed that those that would follow
                        him, would prosper and survive. They travelled north, and found short lived solitude. The
                        shattering was not over, but neither was Haraldr’s reign.

                    <p>
                        She is known as one of the very few people in Prythonia familiar with the works of ancient
                        philosophers, scientists and historians.
                        Her knowledge was proven to be useful during the construction of Noviodunum, the co-ruled
                        fortress of Prythonia and Achæa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She's a loyal Prythonian subject of the Crown and also a strong advocate for the democratic
                        principles. However controversial that might seem.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coming from the community of slave-pedagogues who traced their lineage to a once prosperous kingdom, crashed by Prygos, Melwynn was raised in Tiberia. Her parents were teaching a child of their Tiberian master when the Nasyrik plague started. It took many lives of young Tiberians, but Melwynn's kin was accused of creating the sickness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day the guards of her family's master came and startd a massacre, cutting off heads and hands of the slaves and putting them all in massive fire pits. Only Melwynn and some of her siblings could hide under the corpses of many slaughtered innocent people. Melwynn saw as her mother's warm fingers, which she once used to tickle her, wer burning in a fire, the smell of which she wouldn't even forget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mercy was sent upon Melwynn when she and her siblings were rescued by accident by Galatai merchants who set sail right after the little slaves were brought to ship. Unfortunately, only Melwynn could make it to adulthood since all of her siblings lost their lives during the Shattering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She served as a translator for king Cedric when they came back from the mountains.

                        His past is mostly unknown as he barely talks about it. He appeared out of the mist in the north
                        once the shattering was over. He would hide himself behind a mask to keep his identity and his
                        battle story hidden. Only close friends are allowed to see him in his true form.
                        His skills are decent in most domains and he claims he wants to be a useful part of the new
                        world.

                        When Morvyn was a young boy, his father would always take him fishing in the lake next to the
                        forest where he lived. Morvyn never strayed from the forest. He always followed the rules and
                        kept to the boundaries. When Morvyn was 10 his father suggested that they should go out to the
                        ocean and fish there instead. At first Morvyn was unsure but upon seeing the ocean his nerves
                        calmed and he felt very safe alongside his father. The boat sailed out to the center of the
                        ocean and for hours the father and son fished together. On the return home however the boat hit
                        a storm and capsized. Morvyn’s father drowned. But Morvyn was found on the Prythonian coastline
                        2 years later. Unconscious. All he had was a fishing rod his father gave him before he died. But
                        when Morvyn awoke a month later he could remember nothing of his past. No-one knows how Morvyn
                        survived but some believe he can breathe underwater. He was raised by the Prythonians, but all
                        he
                        wanted to do was fish. It was the only thing he could remember how to do. He is the adopted son
                        of Sigfrid of Suaring and Melwynn of Prythonia.

                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>
                        Regulus was born in a family of farmers. His father taught him how to farm and fish. Fishing
                        quickly became one of his hobbies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His father was forced to go out and fight, Regulus hasn’t seen him since. His mother wasn’t
                        going to let them take Regulus away from her too, so she started teaching him the ways of her
                        family who could communicate with the air; this enhances his hearing and movement which is very
                        handy in getting away unnoticed. He uses this ability to fish even better!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is a proud follower of The Dolphin Gods, which means he can see them in their actions and
                        understand them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His biggest wish is to one day, see his father again.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Political Life</h1>
                    <p>
                        Regulus campaigned to become one of the first senators of The Varian Empire. His slogan was
                        "Livelier Vara". His goals were to bring life into the Empire by whatever means possible:
                        letting animals roam free, having more greenery, more Varians, ... and to make it look
                        beautiful. He delivered his campaign in book form to Varians by putting it in their mailboxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He held a debate with Cornelius behind The Colosseum, where he answered the questions of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He won his position as senator with 6 votes.

                        Sigfrid was born on edge of Varian territory while their parents were buying materials for cheap
                        but was quickly smuggled back into Suaring territory. After a few months Sigfrid's parents were
                        being blackmailed by a witness to their child being born on Varian soil but, business had been
                        tight and they were unable to fulfill their payment for a few weeks. This caused the blackmailer
                        to send a few bandits to scare Sigfrid’s father into paying but the bandits got drunk along the
                        way and ended up killing the father. Now with the family’s main source of money gone and a new
                        child, things were looking grim. The blackmailer stopped contacting them for unknown reasons.

                        bakers. After a few weeks a new job opportunity popped up but it was dangerous work as a
                        smuggler. Now with a job, Sigfrid’s mother was able to get a small room and food. This continued
                        until Sigfrid was 16, which is when his mother got caught. With no money, Sigfrid sold all of
                        their belongings except for a small blade which he kept in his boot. With a good understanding
                        of the criminal world he was able to get a few small jobs for transporting illegal goods over
                        the border. After a few months the Shattering occurred, but instead of crumpling up and dying he
                        was
                        thriving within the chaos. With the excess loot from the dead he was able to raid many castles
                        and sell the weapons. This lead to Sigfrid being the top seller in weapons but that want saying
                        much with the few people still remaining.

                        The plague had little effect for his area, but the monsters did with almost daily attacks. It
                        was
                        hard to find any time to sell weapons. One night he awoke with the sound of screaming and a
                        bright flash of an explosion. Apparently someone had tried to kill one of the creatures with a
                        trap but had an early detonation and blew off a few of their limbs. Sigfrid ran out to help, but
                        saw the horde of creatures that saw the explosion and abandoned the helpless man screaming at
                        him for help to die. As he ran he realized that nothing was there but misery and nightmares. It
                        was a few nights of sleeping in bushes and eating nothing before be found other people. These
                        people had been a family of fellow Suarings but many of their families had died and only a three
                        remained. With hours of planning they set off to find a way of escape but they had been
                        separated in the harsh forests. This left Sigfrid alone once more. Luckily weeks later he found
                        a
                        group that already had a boat and were about to leave. Relived, he hopped aboard and left for
                        the
                        new lands, but he found a note tucked into his sleeping quarters bearing the last name of the
                        family written in blood made out of skin. Horrified he threw it off the ship into to the depths
                        of the sea. Still not knowing how it got there or if it was imagined he stayed awake for weeks
                        to scared to sleep and this is when is mistrust of everyone began.

                        Torsten grew up with his family on a farm before the shattering. He worked hard for the family
                        and always had dedication in him. He'd work every day cutting down trees, or working on the
                        farm. Torsten was not exactly a fighter. He did not focus on combat as he rarely needed to from
                        working on the farm. Although he was skilled at archery from hunting. They say he had the eyes
                        of an eagle when it came to firing an arrow from a bow.

                        When Torsten was only 17, The Shattering started. Torsten's family struggled as they were a
                        small family on a farm. They could not protect themselves from raiders and disease. Torsten and
                        his father did everything to protect the family until his father became too sick to fight. They
                        were dying and Torsten knew it. He knew he had no choice but to leave to seek help. Torsten ran
                        for days in search of help until he found a small settlement with a couple of people. They
                        people told him there was no saving his family and he had to stay with them if he wanted to live
                        after The Shattering. Torsten grew up with these people and worked hard for them. Although he
                        would never forget his family.
