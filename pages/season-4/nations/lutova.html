            <h1>Lutova, of Torn Heritage</h1>
            <p>
                Lutova proudly wears the crown of Quart, or so they claim. As the last of the Quarti provinces to remain
                standing following the civil war, the Lutovans consider themselves the inheritors of the Quarti throne,
                the
                Empireâ€™s legacy, and the continent as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                This militaristic state won not through diplomacy or negotiation, but through blood and cunning. Each
                and
                every rival to the throne was crushed under iron boots, or brought into the fold by chains. Effective as
                this strategy was, it left them weakened and limping.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to recover their might, the Lutovans made the hard choice of opening their borders, an act not
                done
                by the Quarti since the time of the Great Shattering. Promising citizenship and protection to all those
                who
                heeded the call, the population of Lutova nearly doubled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, despite the best wishes of the Lutovan government, the people they had sworn to care for were
                mistreated and abused by those who objected to the opening of the border. With riots and calls for war
                from
                both sides, the then-leader of Lutova made the controversial act of splitting the nation in two, gifting
                the
                northern lands in an attempt to save the new citizens from the leaderâ€™s own making. As such, despite the
                animosity between the two nations, the relations with the new nation of Pakaroo remain that of peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                This choice, whether right or wrong, proved too unpopular among the people, and the leader was pressured
                to
                forfeit their position. In their place, a new leader takes the throne, and has to deal with the growing
                tensions of a still rebuilding nation.
