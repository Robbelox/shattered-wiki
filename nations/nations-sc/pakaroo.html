        <h1>Pakaroo, of Bloodied Loss</h1>
        <p>
            The newest of the nations to call the Sundered Lands home is Pakaroo. Unlike the other powers to call Quart
            their home, Pakaroo is not made of one, united people, but a collection of tribes, clans, and other groups
            from the east and south.
        </p>
        <p>
            For one reason or another, those who would become the Pakari all fled or left their ancestral homes, and
            travelled to Lutova roughly two decades ago. The Lutovans had opened their borders for the first time,
            promising fair wages, shelter, work, and citizenship to any foreigners who wished. Neither Quart nor her
            states had ever allowed open immigration, the act being unprecedented. The offer was appealing to many,
            especially after the last Shattering, and the people came en masse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people who gave everything for the trek would soon be sorely disappointed, however. Met with poor
            working conditions and discrimination, the labour was humiliating and spirit breaking to many, yet they had
            nowhere else to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a riot in a small, Lutovan frontier town that sparked change. Protests and riots soon began to spread
            across Lutova, and it was clear a full blown revolution was on the horizon. Having only just finished their
            last war, Lutova knew they could not afford to participate in another. In a daring and controversial act,
            the then-leader deigned to split Lutovan territory, gifting the northern half to the mistreated labourers in
            both an act of appeasement and desperation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It did not go without notice that the land given was the wild, untamed jungles and plains that Lutova
            considered uninhabitable, yet the Pakari were willing to live with the backhanded insult for the sake of
            freedom from Lutovan discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, regardless of their varied origins, the Pakariâ€™s shared experience as Lutovan labourers built a
            quick cultural identity and sense of comradery. For a time, the people operated successfully without the
            need of a leader to govern them, yet as ever, politics beckoned. The other powers of Quart were unwilling
            and unable to engage in discussion with the ungoverned people, so the Pakari relented and elected their
            first leader.
