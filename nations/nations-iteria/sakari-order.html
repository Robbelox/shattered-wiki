        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The Sakari Order has cloudy origins, most of its records were destroyed during the downfall of Aimeth.
            However, its members have kept oral records of the order and its history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Order was founded roughly 225 years ago in the petty kingdom of Itosea by a young knight named
            Artorious. Artorious was a great warrior, he was a man who men wanted to follow. He would lead men into
            battle and victory, this earned him the privilege of men pledging their lives to him. Realizing he could use
            this honor for something bigger than himself, he created the Sakari Order, which would be a Knight Order
            that serves as an independent guard to Artoriousâ€™ friend, King Lucius of Itosea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Artorious and The Order went on to serve Lucius and expand Itoseaâ€™s borders, expanding Itosea until it
            bordered a rising kingdom that went by the name of Aimeth. At the time, this rising kingdom was somewhat of
            a mystery to the Itoseans. But fate would have these two kingdoms meet on the battlefield; And as Artorious
            was within his older years, he knew this confrontation may end up being his last. And upon seeing a young
            Alexis on the other side of the field, Artorious was prepared to die for his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their fight was a legendary clash that lasted for almost an hour with much blood being shed. At the peak of
            this hour, the sun was blazing, Artorious and Alexis were both drenched in sweat. Even though they both were
            in a state of weakness, Artorious knew he couldnâ€™t keep up this fight much longer. He looked up to the sun
            for a brief moment, and thought about his family, then he made the bold move and dashed at Alexis. Alexis
            barely dodged and slashed Artoriousâ€™ back, he fell down and would never come back up. He died on the
            battlefield, a warrior's death, yet he found it very peaceful.
        </p>
        <p>
            King Lucius did not find the death of his greatest warrior peaceful in the slightest. Artoriousâ€™ death
            caused the levied troops of Itosea to all go into chaos, leaving only the Sakari Order and the Royal Guard
            remaining firm on the battlefield. Lucius then called the remaining soldiers to charge Alexis' position. It
            was a brave, yet pointless assault. Lucius was outnumbered one to ten, and the moment he reached Alexisâ€™
            line, the King of Aimeth took his head.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the death of Artorious and Lucius, Itosea collapsed in an instant. Their lands in shambles, all to be
            claimed by Aimethians. The Aimethians forced the Sakari Order into secrecy and the underground, having
            Artoriousâ€™ son lead the group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Becoming a shadow order, the Sakari kept in hiding and development for roughly a century and a half. Passing
            down the Grandmaster title through the line of Artorious, now belonging to Wilhelm-II. A young ambitious
            fella, with a wish to restore both the Sakari Order, and The Kingdom of Itosea to greatness.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Religion</h1>
        <p>
            The Sakari Order believes in one god, Avigdor, who protects all of those within the order. This protection
            extends to all members and peoples, through life and the after-life. It is believed that everyone passes on
            into Avigdorâ€™s kingdom of Ethesia in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kingdom of Itosea was the Iterian equivalent to Ethesia, many say Itoseaâ€™s downfall was due to straying
            from the path of Avigdor. However, in its past, Itosea has had many great leaders and members, all of whom
            have been said to sit with Avigdor at the greatest of tables for the greatest of feasts. Each of these men
            and women are canonized as saints and are praised as connections to Avigdor.
        </p>

        <h2>Saints</h2>
        <ul class="centered">
            <li>Artorious</li>
            <li>Castus</li>
            <li>Alexander</li>
            <li>Arthur</li>
            <li>Finan</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Customs</h1>
        <p>
            We live a life of service to Avigdor, Itoseans, Ethesians, the Sakari Order, and anyone associated with
            them. We build forts and cities, develop trade with others, and care for the ill-treated. All of our
            devotion and efforts comes from our past and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sakari Order always prays to Saint Castus, patron saint of bravery, before going into battle. Then upon
            leaving battle, they sing and chant the hymn of Arthur. They do this to secure the lives of all men who
            enter the battlefield, leaving their lives in the hands of Castus, Arthur, and Avigdor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon returning home, we bathe in wine to cleanse us of the bloodshed weâ€™ve just been a part of. Then we hold
            mass services for those of whom have perished in conflict. Which services involve intense prayer, sacrifice,
            and feasts.
