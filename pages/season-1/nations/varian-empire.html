                History
            </h1>
            <p>
                Founded a few hundred years ago as a minor Achaean colony, the city that became the worldâ€™s desire had
                small
                beginnings. It was founded by a group of exiles from a minor Achaean city, who wanted to gain power in a
                new
                land. They started by raiding the natives and their neighbouring colonies, gaining goods and slaves that
                were essential to start the new colony.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, the colony grew into a city, and was located on a principal trade zone jutting out into the
                southern seas. It came onto the map soon after, as traders would routinely stop there to trade goods,
                and
                take on food and water. But their principal good of value was slaves. The city leaders would continue to
                conquer the natives, taking on the much needed slaves which they could then sell on to the traders, and
                soon
                the city grew wealthy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with this new found wealth, came a rise in ambition. The city was wracked with internal struggles,
                as
                the inhabitants used their money to try and gain power, causing a power vacuum as the great houses
                fought
                between one another, killing off their opposition. Finally, a great general known as Tiberian seized
                power,
                expelling the landed houses of the city and taking their riches. He was quick to make use of this
                opportunity, using this money to buy mercenaries, and taking over the surrounding Achaean colonies,
                letting
                them choose between subjugation, or the city being burnt to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before long, the entire peninsula was his, and he crowned himself as the leader of a new nation. The
                Empire
                of Tiberia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tiberia was set apart from the other Achaean colonies by its rigid military tradition. The best way to
                rise
                through the ranks was to serve in the army, and win glory against the surrounding natives and colonies.
                The
                only way to survive in the city was to win battles, and Tiberia spent the next century taking over as
                much
                as they could, subjugating all of the Achaean people, and the natives who lived upon the southern sea
                coast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, the city of Tiberia became the new centre of the continent, with traders from across the world
                flocking there to trade lucrative goods from across the Empire. The Imperial Government was centred
                there,
                and the military would parade there whenever they won a triumph against a foreign foe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tiberian Legion was once considered the most fearsome military in the world. Consisting of a
                meticulously organised and disciplined force divided by the decimal, using fearsome tactics and superior
                equipment, they managed to conquer much of the continent in a matter of centuries. Citizens of the
                Tiberian
                Empire are drafted to serve a minimum of 10 years of service, followed by a pension and land grant. This
                system encouraged military service for the poor, and meant that they had no lack of recruits. Of course,
                this system drove on the war machine by needing an ever growing amount of land to hand out, meaning that
                the
                Tiberian Empire had to continue growing to support the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                This military tradition lives on past the Shattering, and each Varian citizen is educated in the art of
                war.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Tiberians were the ones worst affected by the Shattering. Many of the Tiberian cities and
                colonies across the world were wiped out instantly by divine disasters brought on by the godâ€™s wrath,
                causing cities to shake and break apart, great winds strong enough to overturn buildings, and great
                waves as
                tall as mountains hitting the coasts. Not even the royal family were spared, and the direct descendents
                of
                Tiberian himself perished in the events.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only a few Tiberians survived, those from the city of Vara having left the cities and entered the
                mountains
                before the worst of the Shattering occured. It was far from the lush farmlands and trade centres that
                they
                had lived in before, but they managed to continue on despite the desolate area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now the last Tiberian citizens left in the continent, the people strive to reclaim what was once theirs,
                and
                to re-establish the Tiberian Empire in a new age, now reborn like a Phoenix as the Varian Empire.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Religion
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Tiberians worship a religion that is very similar to that of the Achaeans, being based off of the
                same
                traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the center of Pelonian is the pantheon of deities who were said to live on Mount Pelion, the highest
                mountain in Achaea. From their perch, they ruled every aspect of human life. Pelionian gods and
                goddesses
                looked like men and women (though they could change themselves into animals and other things) and were â€“
                as
                many myths recounted â€“ vulnerable to human foibles and passions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The traditional Achaean gods are highly diverse, each of them representing one part of nature, or
                humans.
                This can vary from being an emotion, like a god of anger, to a nature spirit whose lifeforce is tied to
                a
                certain river.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Tiberian gods are very different in style. The gods are much more militarised, to match the
                centralised nation. The God of War is the highest god in the Tiberian pantheon, rather than a god of the
                sea
                as in the Achaean one. The God of Wisdom, is primarily a god of Military Tactics. The good of the forge
                is
                known as the creator of weapons, rather than feats of engineering. In these examples, you can see that
                the
                gods are suited to one thing, and one thing only. War.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Customs
            </h1>

            <h2>
                Icy Greetings
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Tiberians have a custom whereby they drop cold water onto the head of any foreign visitor to their
                lands. It is said that this strange tradition started when a rival nation sent an unwashed tribesman to
                negotiate a peace treaty unsuccessfully, acting as a slight against the Emperor.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, the Tiberians have never dropped the act, and have continued to douse foreigners ever since,
                even
                installing fountains at the entrances to cities so that it always followed.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Godess of War
            </h2>
            <p>
                Within the capital of the Tiberian Empire is the magnificent Temple of Beluna, the goddess of war. This
                site
                is the most important shrine within the Empire, and as such is known as one of the 5 Wonders of the
                Pre-Shattering world. It is said to have reached to the heavens, and to have shone with light each day,
                being built from the finest marble on the continent. The priests who give their lives to the goddess
                wound
                their own arms or legs as a blood sacrifice, to show their devotion to the deity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Temple has an additional political importance within Tiberian society. To declare war on another
                state,
                a javelin is thrown from Tiberian territory into the temple, accompanied by a shout of â€˜Bellum!â€™, as a
                symbolic act considered as the opening of war.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Fantastical Festivals
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Tiberian calendar is filled with festivals to the gods, and with them come celebrations. One of the
                best
                known festivals is that of Vestalia, consisting of a public banquet, private gift-giving, continual
                partying
                and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Tiberian societal norms. It is best known for being the day
                where
                slaves were treated as freedmen, and allowed to wear the â€˜pilleusâ€™ of a free citizen. In some cases, the
                slaves were treated to a banquet, and even to feast together with their masters as equals.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Household Dieties
            </h2>
            <p>
                Each family worships a specific god and will pray or honor their god as a family each week. The deity of
                each family may change based on environmental changes, they may pray to the god of the sea if the family
                becomes fisherman or become sailors. They must make a large offering to the god they are leaving
                however,
                this is to ask for forgiveness and thanks before moving on.
