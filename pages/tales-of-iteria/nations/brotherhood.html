            <p>
                The Brotherhood, formerly known as just "The Brothers," was founded a long time ago but was
                unfortunately
                disbanded a few years later because of different beliefs among the group. It was later revived by Andrew
                Gustav. The Brotherhood was known for their thievery and incredibly experienced assassins. The goal of
                the
                faction was to steal valuables from other factions. But maybe their goals have changed? Maybe their
                goals
                have become more pure-hearted, or maybe they've become worse.

                The original founders, Von Herdies and Scelles Reignfold, were said to be excellent duelists. Some said
                that
                they had won over five hundred battles, while others claimed they hadn't even won one hundred. The two
                founders were found mysteriously dead just a few years later.
