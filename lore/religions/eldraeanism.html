            <h1>
                The Dolcurs
            </h1>
            <p>A long time ago, in a faraway place known as ‚ÄúTiberia‚Äù, a land of factions and conflict, a blacksmith
                called Bob Blackfin was very good at his craft. He was good enough to win several contests and was the
                blacksmith of kings and queens. Even the likes of gods praised his skills, and with their praise came a
                fantastic blessing; they enhanced his weapons, tools, and armor with their divine power, creating things
                beyond what any average mortal could do. But, of course, that did not go unnoticed. Though some gods did
                favor Bob and felt it their right to aid him, some gods disagreed with this sentiment and preferred that
                gods and mortals stay separate forever. One of the gods, the god of everything aquatic, had an idea;
                instead of enhancing Bob‚Äôs weapons like some of the other gods had done, he would curse them. From that
                point on, whoever might come into contact with Bob‚Äôs newly cursed items would be afflicted with becoming
                a dolphin forever!</p>

            <p>The next day, Bob walked into his peaceful smithery in the forest and began his day as usual; he put on
                his apron and protective face shield. He began to walk over to take one of his unfinished swords in his
                hand, unknowing of what was about to happen. As soon as Bob picked up the sword, he started to turn
                grey. The sword in his hand slowly began to slip from his grasp, and he dropped the sword, suddenly
                realizing that his hand had become a fin! He started to stumble around, knocking things over in his
                smithery as he began to gasp for air. He felt a call to water, so he ran towards the nearby beach as
                fast as possible, stumbling across the sand and into the water.</p>

            <p>After a few moments, he relaxed and looked at what was now his fins. He saw a shiny black bit of rock
                nearby which showed a dim reflection of him. He could not believe his eyes; he was a dolphin! Before
                panic could even enter his mind, suddenly something poofed into existence; a green fish with yellow
                marks appeared.</p>

            <p>‚ÄúGreetings, I see you have a problem?‚Äù the fish said.</p>

            <p>Bob did not know at first how to reply, but then he reluctantly and slowly responded to the yellow fish:
                ‚ÄúY-yes, yes I am in an extraordinary predicament!‚Äù.</p>

            <p>In response, the fish said: ‚ÄúDo not fear, for I am Loki, and I am here to save you. Trust in me, and all
                will be well.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Bob looked at the fish, immediately trusting in him with the hope that he may be free of this scourge.
                The fish replied: ‚ÄúThere is a place that goes by the name: ‚ÄòThe Mountain of the Gods‚Äô. Find it, and you
                shall be a human once more.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Before Bob could ask the fish anything more, it disappeared into the water. Bob dove down to find the
                fish, but it was nowhere in sight.</p>

            <p>In the now-abandoned smithy, somebody was asking themselves if Bob would come back. It was not a human;
                it was a squid called Scoodles. This squid was known for being relatively bright and could do some
                things others of his kind couldn‚Äôt. Scoodles got rather hungry, which was very unusual. He was used to
                being full because Bob cared a lot about him. Not having seen Bob in days was rather peculiar.</p>

            <p>He decided to break out of his tank, shattering the glass and crawling downstairs. Following the stream
                of water that was once inside the tank and aware of the circumstances, he knew that heading towards the
                ocean was his next step. Without any hesitations, he began to crawl through the mess Bob had made. He
                stepped on the axes, slid down the shields, and ran through fields of tools. His only objective being,
                escaping the smithery and reaching the ocean unharmed.</p>

            <p>Crawling over branches, through pebbles and sand, he reached the beach. It was only a matter of time
                until he had reached the ocean. That would not happen, as a bird spotted him, a yellow bird with green
                accents. The bird swooped down and put his claws around Scoodles, who didn‚Äôt notice the feathered
                creature flying towards him. He flung his tentacles in all directions, trying to get out of Loki‚Äôs grip,
                but his efforts were to no avail. Scoodles had not turned into a dolphin yet, which was strange, as he
                had touched a couple of cursed items on his way outside. The squid became desperate and concentrated on
                his actions. He swung his tentacles around in a more controlled fashion, trying to harm the bird, trying
                one last time to break free. He concentrated as hard as he could until he felt something tingle. He was
                turning himself into a dolphin, the little sea creature he was. He discovered his new ability. He became
                heavier and heavier, with Loki trying to keep him up as long as possible. At this moment, Scoodles saw
                his chance to escape. He swept his tail up as fast as he could, giving Loki a concussion. The bird began
                to fly towards the ground. Scoodles took his chance and pushed off the bird, launching himself towards
                the ocean. Trying to get a soft landing, he dove into the depths of the sea.</p>

            <p>In the meanwhile, Bob had been keeping himself busy. He hung around with several groups of sea creatures
                and tried to be helpful. In return, he asked for some information about ‚ÄòThe Mountain of Gods‚Äô. While
                most of them didn‚Äôt know a thing about it, some had tiny bits of information, but it wasn‚Äôt much.
                However, it was enough for Bob to gain a sense of direction. He thanked the creatures of the sea and
                swam off in the direction they had given him.</p>

            <p>A little bit further in the ocean, there was some other activity‚Äîtwo dolphins playing around in the coral
                reef. One was named John, the other Barney. They had been friends for several years and had spent a lot
                of time at sea together. But that day was different. While Bob was testing what speeds he could reach,
                John and Barney were enjoying themselves. That was until Bob swam in between them. They were amazed and
                swam towards Bob, trying to catch up.</p>

            <p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a beautiful day today?‚Äù John asked. Not expecting them to have caught up, Bob slowed down and
                decided to talk with them: ‚ÄúA beautiful day it is, especially down here!‚Äù. Barney, the curious one out
                of the two, asked: ‚ÄúWould you like to enjoy the dolphin life with us?‚Äù. Even though Bob would‚Äôve liked
                to, he told them that he was busy and had to continue his travels. ‚ÄúWhere are you travelling to?‚Äù Barney
                asked. Bob sighed and said that he was cursed to be a dolphin and was now trying to regain his human
                form.</p>

            <p>While Barney didn‚Äôt understand why he would want to lift the curse, John had another reaction. Bob and
                John have been friends since childhood, and it seems like they have both gotten the same affliction.
                Only did he have another view of this occurrence. ‚ÄúIt is me, John, John Pelagius!‚Äù he said, and he told
                the whole story of how he became a dolphin, akin to Bob.</p>

            <p>Bob and John had been friends since childhood, and because they had been such good friends, Bob gave him
                a free tool of choice at his smithy. He picked one of Bob‚Äôs tridents and went to sea with it. He was
                greeted by his dolphin friend Barney. He knew that Bob‚Äôs tools were special and wanted to try the
                trident out. He took the weapon by the shaft and threw it into the ocean, but nothing special happened.
                Barney didn‚Äôt come back with it for him either, so he decided to jump into the water to get it himself.
                He saw Barney having trouble getting the weapon out of the sand and went down to try himself. John
                noticed that he was able to swim rather quickly, not experiencing much resistance. He looked at his feet
                and realized that his lower body had become a tail and that his back grew a fin. He accepted his fate
                and saw the best out of it. He could now stay with Barney, wherever he would go.</p>

            <p>As John told his story, Scoodles spotted the bunch. He swam towards the three dolphins as quickly as
                possible. Bob spotted the incoming dolphin and recognized Scoodles, all of his worries had now
                disappeared. They greeted each other and talked about what to do next. The Eldr√¶ans were formed. They
                decided to continue heading towards The Mountain of Gods, traveling at the speed of sound.</p>

            <p>Several hours later, they arrived at the mountain. John agreed to examine the hill but did not notice
                anything special about it. Though, he did see a river flowing down on one of the steep sides. He
                informed the other Eldr√¶ans about it, who decided swimming upwards would be their best bet to regain
                their original forms.</p>

            <p>They began to swim upwards, but it was not easy. At some point, it was even impossible. Though Scoodles
                jumped up, changed into a squid and held onto the rocks above the waterfall. He pulled up the others,
                and they could continue their travels. It was a tall mountain, but eventually, they reached the source.
                ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù John asked the others. They looked around but didn‚Äôt find a lot, only a cave where
                the water emerged. They headed inside the cave and saw an orb of some sort. ‚ÄúCould that be it?‚Äù Barney
                asked the bunch. ‚ÄúI do not know,‚Äù Bob said, ‚ÄúBut we can only find out one way.‚Äù Bob approached the orb
                to scrutinize it until suddenly a burst of laughter appeared.</p>

            <p>Poof, It was Loki! He let the orb float in his hands and looked at the Eldr√¶ans. ‚ÄúWell, well, well, look
                who we have here. You have arrived at The Mountain of Gods,‚Äù Loki said while laughing. ‚ÄúOr so, you
                thought, Bob Blackfin.‚Äù, he continued, ‚ÄúYou have walked into my trap, or should I say, swam. All four of
                you!‚Äù He walked around the cave with the orb still floating in his hands. ‚ÄúThis is where your journey's
                end, dolphin boys! You are all in my hands now!‚Äù He started moving his hands around the orb. Some of the
                water moved towards him, picking him up. Another stream moved up and away from the dolphins, leaving
                them on the cave‚Äôs rocky floor. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, and why are you doing this?‚Äù Bob yelled out loud.
                ‚ÄúOh, you thought I would let you become this powerful?‚Äù Loki said, ‚ÄúWell, you are wrong!‚Äù</p>

            <p>While Loki started his monologue, Scoodles had other plans. He transformed into his original form and
                crawled behind the three dolphins, grabbed them by the tail, and threw them towards the puddle of water,
                held up by Loki‚Äôs orb. As he saw this happen, Loki tried to pull the pool away from the dolphins. But
                the dolphins were already in there. He frantically tried to get them out by moving the puddle around but
                to no avail. The Eldr√¶ans knew how to swim fast, and that they did, agile beings they are. ‚ÄúIt seems
                like we are smarter than you think,‚Äù Bob said, ‚Äúyou might have laughed at first, but look who is
                laughing now!‚Äù The three dolphins looked at each other, at Scoodles, and then at Loki. They immediately
                knew their plan of action. While Loki was still trying to get them out, the dolphins were lining up for
                their attack.</p>

            <p>When it was their time to strike, Bob jumped out of the water with a speed he had never reached before,
                did a flip, and landed his tail against Loki as hard as he could. Loki flew towards the back of the
                cave, trying to catch himself using the orb, but it had flown out of his hands. Barney jumped towards it
                while Loki slammed against the cave wall. He slid underneath it and used a gust of wind to launch it
                towards the ceiling, where John jumped up and kicked it towards Scoodles with a backflip. Scoodles saw
                the orb flying towards him and caught it using his tentacles. His eyes lit up with a blue hue while he
                brought the water back to its original state. Streams of water picked up the dolphins, and the four
                formed a circle around the stream, which had picked up the body of Loki.</p>

            <p>The four Eldr√¶ans reached a state of being, what no creature had ever done before. They were connected
                and formed one unity. They channeled the godlike powers they had in them. Powers they had absorbed from
                the divine enhancements or those from the curse. By using the orb, they even extruded some out of Loki
                himself. The heart of the sea moved to the center and submerged the five in water. It absorbed the
                divine powers, enhanced them, and spread them around the room, turning The Eldr√¶ans into gods. It
                carried The Eldr√¶ans down the mountain, where they continued to help whoever was in need. Loki, however,
                was put deep in the cave, where light did not reach and where life was barren.</p>

            <h1>The Downfall</h1>

            <p>During the battle in the cave, the Eldraeans became enhanced by the orb and gained godlike powers. They
                were able to take on the shape of other creatures and were capable of vanishing in the air. With their
                divinity came the opportunity for new names, more fitting names for gods. And so their names changed.
                Bob became Bofinacle and John, Jorneus. Scoodles, Scellope and Barney, Barn√®s.</p>

            <p>They more or less returned to the lives they had before, to the extent that was possible. Bofinacle and
                Scellope went back to their smithy in the forest and continued to produce legendary equipment. While
                Jorneus started a family and continued faring the seas with Barn√®s.</p>

            <p>Years passed since, but instead of dying, the Eldr√¶ans vanished more often, only to appear again for
                special occasions. As time progressed, their godlike powers weakened. They were fading into nothingness.
            </p>

            <p>The world itself changed too. it was torn apart and raided by monsters. Tiberia was no longer grand; it
                collapsed. Only one small settlement remained. Its name, Vara. Within it, the remains of Bob's smithy.
