            The Khalidian are an ancient people whoâ€™s ancient nomadic tribes are said to have wandered the deserts of
            the world since before the first Shattering over a thousand years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            A reclusive folk, the people of Khalidin are careful to travel away from most settled cultures. Despite
            being relatively peaceful, â€˜civilizedâ€™ cultures historically viewed the people of Khalidin as homeless
            savages. Over the years, the rejection from so many factions led to many Khalidians having an isolated view
            of the world, believing that their homes were better off without any form of assistance or relation with
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oddly, despite such isolationist perspectives, Khalidin is well known for their kindness to foreign
            visitors. Even when they began building solid foundations, their home was still open to all who travelled
            the vast sands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The successors to Khalidinâ€™s nomadic people saw the beauty in settling down and forming homes for their
            families and religions. They began to be known to build giant monuments to their gods, each monument
            dripping with gold that seemed to never end. Many such structures have long since fallen to ruin, however
            ancient temples can still be found half-buried in the sand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the people had settled among the hot sun, their view turned from the sand, to instead what bloomed
            beneath it; gold. The once thought homeless people of the desert now became the wealthiest nation in the
            world. With one foot in the past and one in the future, Khalidian rose up with tradition and wealth. Their
            markets were renowned for unique and hand-made textiles and trinkets, but also beautifully gilded treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Khalidin had learned to endure the Shatterings, the Culling brought a new threat. Entire temples and
            palaces were obliterated, and much of the precious materials and crafts the people valued so much were lost
            in the mayhem.
        </p>
        <p>
            What few people remained took it upon themselves to elect a leader, a style of leadership which had never
            ruled before. Typically the form of leadership in Khalidian was a sultan who passed on their title to their
            first born. This time an elected leader was needed to unite what few of their people remained. For the first
            time in centuries, Khalidin had to pick up their roots and move to find a perfect place on which they would
            be able to regrow safely.
