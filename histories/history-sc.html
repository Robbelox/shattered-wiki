            <h1>Ayka, the Continent of Quart, and the Quarti Empire</h1>
            <p>
                Over eleven hundred years ago, the world, Ayka, was struck by an event that came to be known as the
                Great
                Shattering. This event brought quakes that tore the land asunder, gave rise to the first generation of
                monsters,
                and swept the world with a sickness known as the Nasyrik plague. It was a calamity that many considered
                to
                be
                the end of the world, the doom of civilization. Yet even still, it could not best mankind‚Äôs tenacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shattering would return once a century, bringing forth new monsters, new quakes, and new illnesses.
                Time
                and
                time again, civilization would fall to its knees, and time and time again, they would pick themselves
                up.
                That
                was, until an event known as the Culling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roughly two hundred years ago, on the thousandth year since the Great Shattering, no quakes came. No
                plagues
                swept. No monsters rose. Rather, spectral reapers appeared from thin air, indescribable, and dragged
                mankind
                through the mud. It seemed as if the world, Ayka herself, wished humanity gone from her fields. All her
                fields,
                other than those of Quart.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a distant corner of the world, the shining pillars of Quart stood tall. Older than the nomadic
                Khaladians,
                older than the Kurgan and Hammarish clans that yet sail the seas, older than even the Immortal Empire of
                Vara
                that rules in distant lands. The Quarti Empire had been one of the strongest powers in the world since
                before
                the Great Shattering, and was oft referred to as the peak of civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quarti mythology says that the empire was founded by an ancient order of mages, who blessed the land
                before
                laying their roots. Whether one believes the tales or not, one fact stands empirical: Quart suffered not
                a
                touch
                of the Shatterings that plagued Ayka. Untouched by quakes and free of monsters, Quart earned the title
                of
                ‚ÄúThe
                Unsundered Empire.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
                The people of the world often begged entry to what many had come to consider a holy land, but the
                borders
                remained sealed to all but the wealthiest merchants. Yet, that small number of visitors was enough to
                spread
                the
                Unsundered Empire‚Äôs reputation far and wide, and the people flocked from far and wide. The lands across
                the
                seas
                from Quart grew to become a height of civilization in their own way.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the age old adage goes, all good things must come to an end. On the night of the Culling, over two
                hundred
                years ago, the Quarti Empire came to an end. The millennia old protection that the continent lavished in
                was
                unable to withstand the onslaught of horrid reapers, and the final Empress of Quart, Milanka, was
                embraced
                by
                the cold arms of death.
            </p>
            <p>
                So began the war of succession, where each and every lord and lady with but a drop of royal blood
                flowing
                through their veins vying for the throne. Smelling blood in the water, those who had settled outside the
                borders
                of the Empire took their chance, tearing the dying corpse of the once great nation limb from limb.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the fall of the Empire, so too came the failing of Quart‚Äôs blessings. Two centuries, two
                Shatterings,
                have
                come and gone since. All that has not been buried beneath the earth, or plucked by scavengers, is the
                name
                the
                continent bears: ‚ÄúQuart, the Sundered Land.‚Äù
