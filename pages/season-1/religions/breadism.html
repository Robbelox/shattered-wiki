            <h1>The Breadible</h1>

            <h2>The Bread God</h2>
            <p>The Bread God loves everyone who loves him. <strong>He doesnâ€™t care about your appearance; he cares about
                    the goodness of your heart.</strong></p>
            <p>The Bread God seeks mercy and peace for all. To further his mission, he created the <strong>Holy
                    Bread</strong>, a divine artifact that transforms believers into <strong>Breadians</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Becoming a Breadian</h2>
            <p>To become a Breadian, you must undertake three symbolic actions with bread:</p>
            <p>First, you must kill someone with bread to demonstrate the Bread Godâ€™s power. Then, you must die with
                bread to show that unity is strength and isolation leads to weakness. Finally, you must eat the bread to
                signify your readiness to join the Breadian faith.</p>

            <h2>Finding the Holy Bread</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Holy Bread</strong> is obtained through a sacred ritual involving the High Priest Panisius
                and his companion, Regulus. Panisius, born as a bread, was chosen by the Bread God to share his story.
                The Bread God granted Panisius and Regulus great power.</p>
            <p>To summon the Holy Bread, Regulus must kill Panisius with a divine sword. Upon his death, the Holy Bread
                will be released. To become a Breadian, you must die while holding the Holy Bread. You will then be
                reborn as a Breadian, embodying the Bread Godâ€™s will.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: The Path of a Breadian</h2>
            <p>As a Breadian, you are expected to follow the teachings of the Bread God and abide by these core
                principles.</p>

            <h3>Equality</h3>
            <p>No one is higher or lower than anyone else. All are equal under the Bread God.</p>

            <h3>The Three Roads of the Breadian Faith</h3>
            <p>The Road of Bread is the ideal path for Breadians. It promotes calm, peace, and non-violent solutions to
                problems. The Road of Croissant is reserved for situations where action is necessary but violence is not
                the first resort. This path seeks the best and most thoughtful solutions when all other options fail.
                Lastly, the Road of Baguette is for the most severe and violent problems. Breadians who walk this road
                resort to aggression and force to resolve conflicts. Once on the Road of Baguette, they remain until the
                problem is fully resolved.</p>

            <p><strong>Embrace the Bread Godâ€™s love, walk the roads wisely, and honor the Holy Bread.</strong></p>
