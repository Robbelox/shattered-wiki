            <p>The collective cluster of dimensions forming a single world.</p>

            <h2>Binary Realms</h2>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>A pair of two linked Realms, akin to binary stars. Ayka and Verdan are examples of such Realms.
                Mythology states that Ayka and Verdan were twin sisters, goddesses of life. Verdan was peaceful and
                mischievous, creating life and playing pranks on her sister. Ayka was more immature, prone to violence,
                and easily enraged by her sister's antics. However, this mythology is virtually non-existent in present
                time, with other gods of varying reality belonging to other religions appearing throughout history.
                They may have methods to travel between them.</p>

            <h2>Ayka</h2>
            <p>The Realm and setting of Shattered World, Realms and Crown, which for the past thousand years has had centennial Shatterings
                (with year 1000 being replaced by the Culling).</p>

            <h2>Verdan</h2>
            <p>The Realm and setting of SW2. Before settlers ventured from Ayka, Verdan had no known sapient inhabitants, and is not cursed with Shatterings.</p>

            <h2>Iteria</h2>
            <p>A realm far away from the previously-mentioned binary realms. Only a couple of people have ever managed to travel to this one by mistake. Some characters seem to have existed in both.</p>
