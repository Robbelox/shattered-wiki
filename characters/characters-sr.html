                    <p>
                        Aurelia is a taller than average woman with darker freckled skin, dark brown hair that curls
                        and
                        bounces with every step, and shining emerald eyes. She bears quite a toned build from
                        working
                        with the stone and it's ores, but her smile tells of the softer side of her personality,
                        despite
                        the bags under her eyes
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aurelia's greatest strength is also her greatest weakness: she's a workaholic. She loves to
                        be
                        busy with lots of commissions to fulfill, and thrives on getting the job done and doing it
                        well.
                        However, that means she will go hours doing work nonstop, not breaking for food, sleep, or
                        anything above sitting down while working. This has caused her to pass out from exhaustion
                        at
                        times and fall behind on projects, which frustrates her every time. So she throws herself
                        back
                        into work again after only a short rest, enabling the cycle to repeat again... otherwise,
                        she is
                        quite friendly and always up for a good deal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aurelia's main skills are sharpshooting, overall strength, and bartering; however, she is
                        also
                        an agreeable businesswoman. Being one of the few survivors of her family, she bears the
                        responsibility of running the shop heavily. She can weild most any weapon with ease, but
                        prefers
                        rapid fire artillery over up close and personal combat.

                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Callie Seline was born to a nomadic Hammarish clan roughly a decade and a half prior to the
                        Culling. In her younger life, she was often treated with disrespect by her clanmates.
                        However,
                        when she was around 9 years old, Callie's innate talent for fishing with both rod and spear
                        were
                        discovered, and combined with her lower weight, allowed her to fish on ice too thin for the
                        others. For the next few years, she would become one of the better providers of food for her
                        part of the clan, and earned the respect, whether it be begrudgin or earnest, of her fellow
                        Hammarish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several years before the Culling, when Callie was 13 years old, a band of seafares flying an
                        unkown flag ambushed the tribe in the night. Most warriors were slain, but the women,
                        children,
                        and those skilled in other manners were taken captive, forced to work at their camp. Being
                        too
                        far inland for ocean fishing, Callie was put to work mining surface-level rocks. Callie grew
                        increasingly jaded, and her dependecy on alcohol from her youth grew even stronger, drinking
                        whatever she could get her hands on. When Callie was 16, and the Culling swept across the
                        world,
                        those who held her captive were all but wiped out, her own survival nothing more than luck.
                        In
                        the chaos, she ran.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In months that followed, Callie learned to get what she needed to survive, often through
                        less
                        than respectable means. Despite this, her coin purse never gained much heft, as whatever
                        money
                        she was able to aquire was swiftly loss to a local tavern. It was not until several months
                        ago
                        that Callie began to recover, when Accalia found her passed out drunk not far off a path,
                        and
                        took the girl under her wing.

                    <p>
                        Cthuliar is a hunched back, tall man with bulky muscles and scars scattered everywhere on
                        his
                        body. He possesses long, ginger toned hair and millions of freckles on his face and
                        shoulders.
                        His eyes at first sight may seem disturbing as they were infected a long time ago, making
                        them
                        fully white and oddly blank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He holds deep sorrow and anger inside his heart, making him quite the explosive and cold
                        personality. Yet around those who he holds dear he'll occasionally soften and change to a
                        more
                        pleasant side. Even if he refuses to admit, he finds the most joy in helping his loved ones
                        and
                        his fellow peers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's not a common sight, but occasionally another side of him comes forward, twisting him
                        completely. Then they'll refer to themselves as "Purge".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He bears outstanding combat and stealth skills, unmatched loyalty to his Sultan and endless
                        bravery. Yet occasionally when he can allow himself he'll explode into great anger from even
                        the
                        most smallest things. Great anger issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cthuliar is magnificent in combat, architecture and art skills.

                        no mercy and take what you need. However, she never believed him, for she saw people live joyous
                        lives while still being kind.

                        Of course, she did have her days away from all her father’s pressure. She would spend these days
                        baking, learning herbalism, and studying maps. Her father would say they were useless skills to
                        have, for she would marry a man with servants to look after her and she wouldn't have to work.
                        But she ignored him, for she always enjoyed herself, and to his surprise, she was rather good at
                        them.

                    <p>
                        Coming from the Estomeri family, Leander brings high expectations from his parents. With
                        only a
                        tiny bit of land left belonging to the family in the Meridi lands and the reputation of
                        Estomeri
                        slighted, parents expect Leander to have a great career path and rise up to a high position
                        in
                        the Kingdom or its Parliament.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leander greatly values freedom due to the pressure of his family that he wants to escape,
                        therefore he’s learned a lot of different crafts to try himself in and is pretty
                        adventurous.
                        However, the feeling of being lesser than other nobles still stays somewhere deep in his
                        heart,
                        so he tries to compensate for it by wearing fancy clothes - fashionable button-up military
                        style
                        jackets, flare pants and clean shirts with long flare sleeves. His hair is black, slightly
                        curly
                        and always taken care of, he has blue eyes and is of medium height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leander is characterized as liberal, generous, and freedom-seeking. He tends to base his
                        decisions on logic, which often clashes with his temperamental side. Despite his sincerity,
                        he
                        can be blunt and obnoxious at times. While he tries to be somewhat helpful, he prefers to do
                        things in peace. Leander needs to learn friendly and non-official communication and to let
                        people close to him. He is weak-willed, struggles with criticism, lacks patience, and has
                        issues
                        with loyalty, making him a fair-weather friend. Leander is often flirtatious, although
                        sometimes
                        his timing is inappropriate. He is not a good fighter; rather, he tends to flee from
                        confrontation.

                    <p>
                        Nox is an old Varian loyalist who believes in the empire and its greatness. He was raised
                        along
                        his older brother by ancient establishers of the empire and has been taught to sacrifice
                        whatever it takes for the emperor and the Varian flag. As he reached adulthood, he joined
                        the
                        military forces and fought for the great empire along his brother’s side. He went through
                        multiple wars and survived them by an inch of his life, coming home safely after every one
                        of
                        them. When there was a peace period, Nox would spend his time mining for the empire and
                        supplying its builders and blacksmiths with resources. He found his peace of mind in this
                        kind
                        of work, although he doesn’t mind farming either.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However one night, he was summoned by strategists to defend a Varian territory from an
                        attacking
                        nation. Sadly, the defensive layout was leaked and the army was hit in their blind spot. As
                        arrows came flying, Nox was ready to embrace his death until he opened his eyes and realized
                        his
                        brother took the arrows for him. Nox lost his brother in front of his eyes and his army
                        fell,
                        leading to a Varian loss. As the broken soldier walked back home, scarred and defenseless,
                        he
                        was greeted by his mother’s screams and cries reacting to the news. From that moment, she
                        kept
                        yelling at Nox words such as “The wrong son died”, “You failed to protect our land and even
                        your
                        brother in blood, you could not even bring his corpse back to be honored.” and “You will
                        never
                        replace your brother.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These paroles left a gaping hole in Nox’s heart, making him quit the military service for
                        that
                        time and put his all into mining to repent for his sins and weakness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the cogs of time kept turning, Nox started losing his purpose and giving in to alcoholism
                        and
                        hated life more than ever. He felt pointless and miserable, losing his family and
                        belongings.
                        However, the culling hit hard and it changed Nox within. He saw his survival as a new chance
                        in
                        life and the fire in him was lit once more, even if he was past his prime. He saw the
                        Empire’s
                        survival as a prophecy for its greatness and held his grip to his loyalty even tighter than
                        ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nox is determined, patient and strong-willed person, even he is far past stability. He works
                        hard for the Empire and to serve it the way he was taught. However, he is an alcoholic old
                        man
                        who is past his prime, physically and mentally. He seeks knowledge but fears losing his own.

                    <p>
                        Octavian is the youngest son of a Varian noble family. They have been loyal to the Varian
                        Empire
                        and it's emperor for centuries, and so is he. His family is one of the few that can trace
                        their
                        bloodline back to the Varian Empire's first iteration, right after the fall of Tiberia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, he was taught many things, but he quickly showed to have an affinity towards
                        building. He was fascinated by all sorts of castles and forts, palaces and other
                        fortifications.
                        His father disliked this, as he had wanted Octavian to be a fierce warrior like his
                        ancestors,
                        but most efforts to teach him how to properly use a sword did not have any lasting effect.
                        It
                        was only with bows that Octavian proved to be of any help in combat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the culling, he lost everything. All of his family members were killed, their
                        mansions
                        and castles destroyed. The only thing he had left was his undying loyalty to the Varian
                        Empire
                        and his will to rebuild it, to raise it's flag above that of all other nations once more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is a good architect, although he refuses to use Stone Bricks. He knows how to use a bow,
                        but
                        other than that he is a pretty bad fighter. He will put the interets of the Empire above
                        those
                        of anyone else, not caring about the consequences.

                    <p>
                        Before the Culling Riad was a well known business man with his hand often on gold filled
                        scales.
                        He had previously been a high treasurer to the ruling Sultan and watched over much of the
                        old
                        nations gold supplies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Riad is like many of the native Khalidians, his skin is warm and his hair is dark. Even in
                        his
                        ageing years his hair has stayed the rich colour he was born with and has yet to begin to
                        salt
                        and pepper. Matching the dark hair on his head, is the dark hair that paints his face; Cut
                        neatly beneath his nose and framing his cheeks is a thick beard which curls up cheekily as
                        he
                        smirks. In the year since the Culling he has been able to reproduce and repair some of his
                        older
                        garments and is frequently seen in differing shades of blue, a colour he says brings out the
                        green in his eyes and the gold of his earrings. His earrings are his most treasured
                        possession
                        as they were made from the first pieces of gold he ever came upon when he was a boy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Riad first and foremost is charismatic and secretive. Gold is money, info-textrmation is
                        wealth. Any
                        chance for some nugget of knowledge is one Riad will happily take. With this in mind, Riad
                        wouldn't let anyone pass up the opportunity to pay with info-textrmation. While he is
                        charismatic and
                        can talk the hind legs off a donkey, he is never without mystery. He can disappear for days
                        at a
                        time and return as if he had never left, simply saying he "was out on business". In
                        combative
                        situations Riad will always try using his words to settle the disagreement, wanting to avoid
                        physical fighting until absolutely necessary. He may even invoke the assistance of others to
                        hide his tracks as he leaves, or use curious potions to allow him to disappear completely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Riad plays both sides of the coin, weighing up the perfect balance of both the current
                        situation
                        and those to come. This can be a boon or a curse as he tries to work out moves ten steps in
                        advance. His strength lies in what he knows but doesn't tell, leaving much to the
                        imagination of
                        others. Riad's weaknesses can be in his physical ability and often distaste for himself to
                        be
                        violent, because of this he tries to find ways out of those situations and could possibly be
                        read as weak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His main skills are those in deception and observation. He also does well with planning and
                        finding gold.

                    <p>
                        For centuries, the Garaffuls have been a family of high status. The first, religious leaders
                        from back when the portal opened. Tales said the family stems from divinity. Every 4th
                        generation, it has been tradition for the eldest son to preach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tohkah is next, but ever since he was born he has had a passion for writing. Trying to
                        maintain
                        the family’s high status while following his passion, he got himself into the position of
                        sultanic advisor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All was well until the Culling swept through the lands and took his family. Tohkah remained
                        alive; changed as a person. The incapability of protecting his relatives left him alone; his
                        life disappeared in front of him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His grief led him to wander the path of violence, making him vent on all evil that remained.
                        That would become his next arc; the Arc of the Protector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was a creative man with good status and a keen eye. Now he remains a man of little words.

                        Publius Valerian didn't expect to be an emperor growing up, but here he is. He has tanned
                        skin,
                        with blue eyes, and prefers to remain in the garments from his days as a soldier than any
                        sort
                        of Imperial garment. He has dark brown hair and a scar on his left eye. He enjoys luxury,
                        but he
                        also likes to be hands on with many aspects of his empire, especially the military. He
                        didn't
                        inherit the throne, instead being a barracks emperor, but he commands respect. He is
                        dedicated
                        towards giving the best life possible to every Varian citizen, and he will go to great
                        lengths
                        to ensure it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Publius Valerian is a confident man. He walks with his head up, and he likes to the one in
                        charge in the room. He doesn't like wasting his time on people he deems foolish. He has
                        previous
                        experience as an officer in the military. Valerian is quite fond of speaking to his people
                        as
                        well, which can paint him in a good light to most.

                    <p>
                        Valerian is often arrogant, leading him to underestimate his opponents. He also gets rather
                        hot-headed and can say some harsh words in the heat of the moment. Due to his confidence he
                        sometimes has little room in his head for such things as "reason." He also has a bit of a
                        problem with alcohol from his old days in the military. He often does foolish things when
                        caught
                        up in situations while drunk.

                        Valerian has been into a variety of fields since he was young. He liked speaking to people,
                        he
                        liked building various buildings, and he had a commitment to whatever grand thought crossed
                        his
                        mind. Valerian wants to incorporate all of these skills into his leadership to bring his
                        dreams
                        of glory to the Varian Empire!
