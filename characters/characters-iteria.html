                    <h1>Backstory</h1>
                    <p>Hundal was born as the son of a Human and Elf, making him a Half-Elf; his parents cherished him.
                        He doesn't remember a lot about his parents but he knew that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His mother, Rhavonne, was seen as foreign. The elves didn't enjoy the prescence of people
                        without
                        elf-blood flowing through their veins. As tensions grew between her and the tribe, she was cast
                        out.
                        "Follow your heart," were the last words she spoke to baby Hundal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hundal lived his toddler years in the Hundelle tribe. It was a hard endeavour to take care of
                        little
                        Kaitun, but his father persevered. Without him, Hundal wouldn't have survived, as the tribe did
                        not warp
                        an eye on him. Hundal was seen as impure in the tribe, which made it hard for his father to keep
                        him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As time progressed, it became obvious that Hundal wasn't going to spend his teen years in the
                        tribe. As
                        he grew older and gained knowledge of the world, the aversion of the tribe grew. They called him
                        Chkatan
                        Hundal out of disrespect and distanced him from the tribe. His father knew it was urgent to
                        teach Kaitun
                        how to survive. He taught his son about plants, shelter and the art of hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He knew that Hundal wouldn't be able to remember everything at that age. He proceeded to switch
                        to
                        teaching basic skills as writing and reading. In the meanwhile he wrote a small pocketbook of
                        what he
                        was trying to teach before. Whenever Hundal would need something, he would be able to find it in
                        this
                        book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The time had arrived; Hundal's father couldn't procrastinate any longer. Hundal was banished at
                        the age
                        of 8 and had to survive in the wild with the aid of his father's book. In his first years, he
                        made do
                        with foraging, but as he grew older, he started to dabble in the Art of Hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once in a while he stumbled upon a settlement where he set up camp for a while. In his early
                        years,
                        people would have mercy with him, but as he grew older he had to use his long fingers. He used
                        these
                        settlements to stock up, but whenever he did, he had a bad feeling in his heart. He knew
                        stealing wasn't
                        right and made do with the bare minimum. Since then, he has always had a disgust for people who
                        do for
                        wealth.

                        He spent fourty years as a nomad and kept learning new things which he added to his father's
                        notebook.
                        During these periods he mostly hung around with animals, as he had grown paranoÃ¯d of humanoids.

                        During one of his learning expeditions, he stumbled upon a burning village with goblin camps on
                        the
                        edges. He decided to investigate it and called it Mission Green Goblin. During this mission, he
                        worked
                        together with some animals: Wilkins (Dog), Smittens (Cat), Fiddles (Donkey), Rasuza (Dog) and
                        Kat (Cat).
                        He found some buildings around, but no real clues of any Goblins. He wrote his findings down in
                        a diary.

                    <p>
                        During his investigations, he was found by Wilhelm, the leader of the Sakari Order; who promised
                        him
                        futher investigations when he would join. Hundal proceeded to accept the offer and joined the
                        Sakari
                        Order where he documented . The world started to change shortly after: meteors became a common
                        thing and
                        nature stopped.

                    <p>
                        The goblin investigation promise was never fulfilled as there were now bigger things to
                        investigate.
                        Plant growth is an important matter in terms of survival. Without, Hundal had to make use of his
                        hunting
                        proficiency more as time progressed.

                        An expedition towards the north of Nindal came into the planning of the Sakari Order. It was
                        during this
                        expedition where Hundal began to talk to a couple: Teri and Niko. Hundal lost track of Wilhelm
                        and
                        decided to stick with those two; that's when a meteor storm approached. The bunch decided to
                        take
                        shelter in a cave, which has become a big part of Hundal's life. They went to a big tree, and
                        that is
                        where Hundal left the expedition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in Avisburg, life became boring when Wilhelm went missing. To spend his time, Hundal formed
                        Hundal's Horse Homes; where he analysed the Sakarian horses and took care of them. During this
                        period,
                        he got acquainted with Ashari Oakenheart who owned a mule called Fenton. Hundal targetted this
                        mule to
                        be the first one to be analysed. Ashari was against that, but after hanging around Ashari's
                        house for
                        some time, he did it anyways. This caused some people to suspect him for beastiality, but that
                        faded
                        away after a while. After some weeks, he moved out of the house he was given and built a small
                        lodge
                        next to Ashari's house. The grass began to grow again shortly after.

                    <p>
                        Shortly after, Ashari invited him to The Gatesmen. There he was told about the mission: digging
                        away a
                        1001x1001 perimiter; thus Hundal started to work. He dug away some ground, drained all of the
                        rivers and
                        chopped down a reasonable amount of trees. The last two mostly being due to a punishment he was
                        given
                        for protecting the Gatesmen Tower from Harry, who was intruding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There, Hundal became good friends with Ghostbelio with whom he worked away, but after some time
                        Ashari
                        passed away due to a failed ritual and Ghostbelio left The Gatesmen. Hundal hadn't seen Ashari
                        for weeks
                        before the ritual and hasn't since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Ashari's passing, the leadership was transferred to The Harbinger, but Hundal never saw
                        this black
                        pig as his rightful leader, as he thought Ashari was still alive. The Harbinger disappeared too,
                        and
                        with the two previous leaders missing in action, Hundal took the position as leader of the
                        Gatesmen
                        after finding a message. With it, he found a mysterious crystal, which he put inside of the
                        ender bag
                        which came with it. Whispers started to echo through his head asking him to join.

                        Ghostbelio came back with the company of Niko and an unknown person, but not on good terms. They
                        attacked Hundal, leaving him severely wounded for unknown reasons. When they left, Hundal
                        patched up his
                        wounds. While doing that, he heard footsteps in the main hall of the tower. He took a look and
                        found the
                        young, unknown, white-haired person who came with the two attackers. He used all his strength
                        and went
                        to talk with the boy who was appreciating the tower. He managed to lead him to the dungeons
                        where he
                        asked for explanations. The boy, Ozen, explained that he went with them because he was looking
                        for
                        something to be a part of. Hundal grew fond of Ozen and asked him if he wanted to become a
                        Gatesman,
                        which the boy accepted. Along with Ozen, they were now the two remaining Gatesmen, as everyone
                        had left
                        after the passing of Ashari.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hundal decided to stop the dig and divided the capital project into smaller, more enjoyable
                        steps. The
                        first projects being cleaning up and improving existing builds. Together they transformed the
                        tower into
                        an impressive castle and fixed up the basement of the tower.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the cleanup, Gatesmen joined and left. One of them being Ghostbelio, he was on a quest to
                        become
                        human once again and became an undead by once again connecting to his body. He ended up being
                        murdered.
                        Ozen grew and became a worse person after time, which Hundal did not want. At some point Ozen
                        became too
                        psychopatic, which caused him to be kicked out by Hundal with the promise of him being able to
                        come back
                        once he had changed his ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another problem was the crystal taking control over Hundal. The whispers became louder and
                        louder.
                        Hundal couldn't ignore them anymore and was willing to go in on them, doing what his head was
                        telling
                        him. In his bed he had a faint memory, "Follow your heart," he remembered. This was followed by
                        another
                        voice whispering in his head, "Follow your heart, Kaitun. You can choose your own path now."
                        Hundal took
                        the crystal out of his bag and threw it into the End Gate which has been sitting in the basement
                        for
                        ages. His head became silent and his heart glowed, he became aware of another feeling: magic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The End Gate was sending out strong waves of magic which made him feel a flow of energy. He
                        studied them
                        and learned how to use them for movement. With his knowledge, he created The Gatesmen Castle
                        Elevator
                        and the Gatesmen Castle Gate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New people came knocking on that Gate: Arrow, Elyon, Tulip... As well as some familiar faces
                        asking for
                        forgiveness. Niko and Ozen rejoined the Gatesmen and are becoming good people under the
                        teachings of
                        Hundal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Rising Tensions
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A couple of months later, Ozen killed Avie by accident which caused him to be depressed.
                        Although Hundal
                        doesn't like what he did, he still helps Ozen through it as he has experienced depression of all
                        types
                        himself. When Sten and Aisha intruded, Hundal was up for protecting Ozen by lying, but a
                        contract he was
                        forced to sign would have been the cause of his demise. The negotiations went harm-free, but
                        tensions
                        had risen between Hundal and those two, they wouldn't be touching Ozen over Hundal's corpse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not too long after, Aisha came to apologise, while Sten wrote a trading contract for a spear
                        Hundal had
                        acquired. This got him his Chinmoku No Shi back, and trust slowly began to grow again. They were
                        not
                        allies, but they could stand each other more or less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was until the coronation of the Ashaiian Queen, where Sten went insane and slashed whoever
                        he could
                        to grab whatever amount of gold he could get his hands on. With a pierced back, Hundal
                        considered the
                        attack the last straw; he lost all of his trust in Sten. It was a long and painful walk home,
                        where he,
                        with a lot of effort, healed up again. Not too long ago, his protective staff was stolen,
                        wherefor he
                        had to purchase a new restorator. He got help from a new Gatesmen called Alcaeus Galadher, who
                        got
                        taught the lesson of never putting all of your trust into a person.

                    <p>
                        Long ago, a wizard testing necromancy for the first time got their hands on Vivi to experiment on. The wizard wanted to track Vivi's soul from death so they could summon a demon of her. Because of the wizards tampering, ViVis soul went to the end instead of the nether and the wizard was not able to summon back her soul to the overworld. Trapped in the end, Vivi's soul tried to inhabit endstone like demons do in the nether with netherrack and blackstone, but endermen kept pulling her apart before she could stay for long. Instead, Vivis soul almost disapeared, but the ammount of time she spent inside endstone stabelized her. She was only able to find her way back to the Overworld a little while ago

                    <p>
                        Has invisibility because shes a ghost kinda, but also speed from being lighter and whispier than normal ghosts. But, she has really bad weakness (like cant even hit stuff with a sword or axe) and only a few hearts and is damaged by water because of all the time her soul spent mixing with the end magic from the end
