                        In the overworlds of both Ayka and Verdan, humans dominate as the most common species, often the
                        sole encounter for many.

                    <p>
                        While humans are praised for their resilience, both mentally and physically, their tendencies
                        toward ignorance and destructiveness are widely acknowledged. Prioritizing expansion over
                        peaceful coexistence with their surroundings has led to significant environmental damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Iteria, humans stand as one of the oldest species, alongside Faes and Shifters.

                    <p>
                        Despite their comparatively shorter lifespans, humans hold pride in their role in driving many
                        of Iteria‚Äôs innovations, though their individual impact may appear less enduring compared to
                        other species.

                    <p>
                        Dwarves are inhabitants of mountainous regions or deep caves, where they indulge in activities
                        such as mining and exploring underground caverns. They possess a keen fascination with minerals
                        found in the depths of the earth, particularly gold, and their culture is richly developed,
                        placing high value on history and the origins of their species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having adapted to the perpetual darkness of their underground habitats, Dwarves have also
                        developed immunity to the venom of Cave Spiders over time. Their stature is typically shorter to
                        navigate through narrower cave passages, and they experience discomfort and weakness in sunlight
                        due to its intense brightness. While Dwarves boast physical strength necessary for mining
                        significant quantities of stone, they are not inherently inclined towards warfare.

                        Shifters trace their lineage back to Faes and Humans. Once possessing the ability to shift into
                        various creatures, their lineage has evolved over thousands of years. Crossbreeding has diluted
                        their blood, stripping them of their shapeshifting prowess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite their name, Shifters can no longer assume alternate forms. Instead, they exhibit one or
                        two physical animal traits, like horns, fangs, or animal ears. Moreover, they retain
                        advantageous Abilities, including underwater breathing and enhanced night vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Characterized by individualism, Shifters lead nomadic lives, cherishing their uniqueness.
                        However, they aren't renowned for combat skills; in fact, they often lag behind humans in
                        strength, teetering on fragility.

                        Faes, alongside Humans and Shifters, stand as one of the oldest species, giving rise to Elves
                        and Lizardkin. They're viewed as more magical beings compared to Elves, who lean towards
                        nature-centric pursuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There exist three distinct types of Faes: Northern, Southern, and Central. Central Faes, the
                        offspring of the former two, lack their own unique culture and often face societal exclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faes typically feature pointed ears and may sport hair dyed in vibrant hues like bright blue or
                        magenta. They boast an impressive lifespan of up to 10,000 years, with each century equating to
                        one human year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wings, a defining feature of Faes, are often sought after, leading to their frequent hunting and
                        the brutal removal of their wings. The Northern Faes possess grand, crystal-like wings of deep
                        blue, highly prized for their beauty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, the harsh conditions of the Southern regions have shaped the wings of Southern Faes
                        to resemble those of dragons: sturdy, brownish, and remarkably resilient. Central Faes possess
                        the most coveted wings, melding the characteristics of both Northern and Southern Faes,
                        resulting in wings of unparalleled beauty and durability.

                        mercenary work if they become isolated.

                        Endermen, ancient inhabitants of the End, exhibit peculiar behaviors, displaying a semblance of
                        intelligence but lacking true awareness of their surroundings. They manifest in three distinct
                        types: Green, Violet, and Blue.

                    <p>
                        Green-eyed Endermen represent the pinnacle of intelligence among their kind. Their rarity and
                        diplomatic potential make them highly sought after, though unfortunately, few remain due to
                        relentless hunting.

                    <p>
                        Violet-eyed Endermen dominate the population, characterized by a seemingly mindless demeanor
                        under the control of the Ender Dragon. They possess little awareness of their environment and
                        communicate through an enigmatic language that defies comprehension.

                    <p>
                        Blue-eyed Endermen, equally scarce, have broken free from the Dragon's influence through magical
                        or other means. While retaining aspects of their former intelligence, they may occasionally
                        lapse into Violet-like behaviors, such as using their language. Memory lapses are common among
                        this group.

                        humans. Unlike their Endermen counterparts, they lack teleportation Abilities but share a common
                        aversion to water, which can cause them harm.

                        The conflict between Villagers and Illagers dates back to ancient times, originating from when
                        both species were part of a powerful, god-like race known as The Vi thousands of years ago.

                        The division among The Vi arose during a period when Humans faced extinction. One faction sought
                        to protect the humans, while the other aimed to eradicate them. Unable to reconcile their
                        differences, war ensued, resulting in the pro-human faction becoming Villagers and the
                        anti-human faction becoming Illagers. The Villagers emerged victorious, relegating the Illagers
                        to a weakened status on the sidelines.

                        Pandafolk are a tragic byproduct of Vi experimentation. Originally intended to enhance the value
                        of pandas through weaponization, the experiments only succeeded in creating intelligent, bipedal
                        beings. Dispersing throughout Iteria, Pandafolk have eked out existence in jungles for
                        millennia, organizing into small clans. However, their numbers have dwindled steadily over time,
                        relegating them to the realm of folklore in the eyes of most Iterian inhabitants.

                        When a living being perishes, their soul typically finds itself in the Soul Sand Valley of the Nether, indistinguishable among the multitude of other resting souls. However, souls of exceptional strength or those with holy lineage may occasionally extricate themselves from the sand. These souls gradually assume physical forms, comprised of nether materials such as soul sand, netherrack, and blackstone, bound together by the magical essence of numerous souls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These forms, known as Demons, exist exclusively within the Nether. Unable to endure in the overworld without substantial magic, they require summoners who can share their living magic, allowing the Demon to traverse to the Overworld in its unstable, nebulous body crafted from nether materials and magic, or to inhabit another human vessel. The process of merging a Demon with an existing body invariably corrupts it to varying degrees, contingent upon the ritual performed. Post-ritual, Demons may resemble anything from slightly altered humans to wholly unrecognizable creatures reminiscent of ancient descriptions of monsters.

                    <p>
                        Demons harness the power of numerous souls, each nearly indistinguishable from the next. However, the most potent souls may retain traces of individuality, manifesting as fleeting, vague memories and abrupt changes in behavior or desires. These memories often appear as static images rather than coherent events, causing confusion and inconsistency in the Demon's behavior.

                        environments if it serves to foster future chaos. Trust is hard-earned with goblins, but once
                        established, it endures for life, and some may even forsake their chaotic tendencies for the
