                Oberon Island
            </h1>
            <p>
                Oberon's Island was grown straight from the earth to be a space for all nations to work together. No
                matter the social or political climate of the Kingdoms, all were welcome to Oberon's home and be on
                neutral ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the world around Oberon grew, so did his island, things were built so that Kingdoms could come
                together in peace. The Emerald Bank was a centre of economy for Verdan, The Diplomatic Centre for
                political meetings and The Markets for worldwide trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Island will continue to bloom as a place for all.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the centre lies the last standing portal to Hell. It was decreed that this would be the only one to
                remain as the others were becoming unstable and bringing elements from other worlds to Verdan. Across
                the land are still scattered remnants of portals and ruins.....
