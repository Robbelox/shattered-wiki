        <h1>
            History
        </h1>
        <p>
            The misty hills of north-western Tiberia are dominated by the Galatai clans, the original inhabitants of
            much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have borne witness to countless wars fought to resist
            outside invaders: the Empire's legions, the ever present Kurgan to the west, and their close kinsmen to the
            west. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, the sudden wild charge out of the woods. They idolise
            valour, but especially like it when mixed with a bit of mischief - the cattle thief who can whisk an entire
            herd into the fog; the champion who dines with a rival tribe, and, regaling his hosts with an anecdote of
            battle, produces from his bag the skull of one of their kinsmen that he took as a souvenir.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name Prythonia comes from ancient Achaean explorers, who noted the difference between these people to
            their western cousins. The Prythonic people would paint their skin different colours, and from this came the
            name, derived from the Achaean words for â€˜painted peopleâ€™.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prythonian people are slightly different to their eastern kinsmen. Being further north, the lands were
            less fertile, and the people relying on the hilly highlands rather than the lush forests. As such, the
            people have a much harsher outlook on life, and are much harder in order to survive. Being closer to the
            Kurgan people of the snow, they also have spent centuries in a series of raids upon their land, resulting in
            the settling of some Kurgans within their culture that eventually assimilated, bringing with them a
            collection of new Bastaerni words to the language.
        </p>
        <p>
            From time immemorial there has been a High King of Prythonia, crowned with great ceremony on the sacred
            hills of Rhea. Ask any Prythonic chieftain, however, whose "kingdom" he lives in, and he will look around at
            his hall and in his fields and his pastures, his flock and his retainers, and answer "Mine, of course." Only
            lately, following the shattering of the continent, have the High Kings made any effort to exert their
            authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the Shattering, the Prythonic people were united under a single High King, the first one in
            centuries. The people benefitted richly from the breakdown of the natural order, and the near total
            extinction of their hated rivals, the Tiberians. Under his command, and personally leading them, the
            Prythonians conducted raid after raid into the declining Empire, bringing back gold, food and most
            importantly slaves to work their own poor soil. For a while, the kingdom grew into one of the richest in the
            worlds, rivalling ----.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is, until the impacts of The Shattering spread to the Prythonians themselves. The slaves and food that
            they brought back to their homeland were infected by the vile plague, and the Prythonic people were
            decimated by the Nasyrik epidemic. It started with their slaves dying, and then their crops and livestock.
            Finally it fell upon the ruling classes, now starved of food and forced to flee to escape infection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people were taken north by a young noble by the name of Cedric, who fought his way through the
            apocalyptic world to secure a safe haven for the remainders of his people. They lived among the mountains
            and forests, trusting no one for years, until finally the world reached a new age.
        </p>
        <p>
            He led his people down the mountain, and was greeted to a new world. The continents had shifted, water
            levels had risen, and most importantly, there were no armies to oppose him. Leading them south towards the
            fertile lands of the seas, he settled his people within the forests of another Galatai people, that are now
            lost to the ages.
        </p>
        
        <h1>
            Religion
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Galatai people worship the gods of nature, mainly those of the forests, rivers and highlands that they
            inhabit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who have a close connection with the gods are chosen to become Druids, who use natural goods to create
            items to bring the human mind closer to the realm of the gods. These items are usually inhaled or ingested,
            and induce a magical state that distorts your view of the world, allowing some to even speak with divine
            beings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to this connection with the gods, the Druids hold a high place in the Galatai society, and are often at
            the left hand of the king to provide divine judgement.
        </p>
        
        <h1>
            Customs
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Marriage
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Prythonic people have marriage customs that seem downright barbaric to the more â€˜civilisedâ€™ nations
            which sit on the southern seas. While they may ask for a parentâ€™s blessing, or create marriage pacts to
            secure dynasties, the Prythonic men take a more literal approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            To take a woman as yours, you must steal away the bride-to-be from their house, and take her into the woods
            where a druid will administer the rites. The Prythonic women will only be taken by a man that is worthy of
            stealing her, and through this only the best men are chosen. This custom is a display of strength, cunning,
            guile, and most importantly, bravery. There is that slight threat of being killed while stealing a manâ€™s
            daughter, of course. But still, men take the risk despite the dire consequences.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Battle
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before going into battle, the Prythonic people take the time to bathe, wash, and dye themselves. They have
            springs throughout the land for washing, and a number of them dot the woodland border where they frequently
            spar with the southern invaders. To colour themselves, they use a flowering plant that produces a
            watery-blue dye, which when applied is liable to scar the skin. These scars are a symbol of strength within
            their society, as an example of the many battles you have fought in and returned victorious
        </p>

        <h2>
            Greetings & Bowstrings
        </h2>
        <p>
            A common Prythonic greeting is to put two fingers to your lips, before raising them up towards the other
            person, showing your palm to them. This action symbolises friendliness as these fingers are highly important
            to every man, as their means of stringing their bow, and a symbol of strength within the society. This
            greeting has been used by the Galatai people for centuries, as a way of showing that you are friendly to one
            another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those without these fingers are treated as outcasts of society, figures only fit for fighting with sword and
            shield. Due to this, a common tactic used by warring chieftains is to take a manâ€™s fingers to ensure that
            they will not fight against him again.
        </p>
        <p>
            This greeting has been used by the Galatai people for centuries, as a way of showing that you are friendly
            to one another.
        </p>

    <h2>
        Rings of Wealth
    </h2>
    <p>
        Instead of purses of gold, or hiding your money away, the Prythonic people wear their wealth in the form of
        rings on their arms. These arm rings are a status symbol for the Prythonians, as a show of how wealthy you are,
        and as such how many battles you have won. The rings are made up of a vast array of metals, from common bronze
        to shining gold, and are a show of the feats you have undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wealthy leaders of the Prythonic warbands have been known to jangle with each step as the multitude of rings on
        their enormous arms hit against one another.
        To be recognised as a member of a manâ€™s warband, there is a ceremony where the man is gifted one of the arm
        rings off of the leaderâ€™s arms, which is engraved with their emblem.
    </p>
    <p>
        This exchange of wealth ties the men together for life, and is an unbreakable bond between warriors. Any man
        that goes against it is shunned in Prythonia, regardless of their personal wealth or status.
