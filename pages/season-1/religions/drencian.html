            <h1>Drencian</h1>

            <p>The Galatai people worship the gods of nature, mainly those of the forests, rivers and highlands that
                they
                inhabit.</p>

            <p>Those who have a close connection with the gods are chosen to become Druids, who use natural goods to
                create
                items to bring the human mind closer to the realm of the gods. These items are usually inhaled or
                ingested,
                and induce a magical state that distorts your view of the world, allowing some to even speak with divine
                beings.</p>

            <p>Due to this connection with the gods, the Druids hold a high place in the Galatai society, and are often
                at
                the left hand of the king to provide divine judgement.</p>
