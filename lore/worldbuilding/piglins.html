                About
            </h1>
            <p>A pig-like humanoid species native to the Nether. Due to having evolved in the Nether's life-sustaining
                environment, they are incapable of surviving outside of it without zombifying. Due it's life-giving
                properties, Piglins see the material "gold" in an almost holy view.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>They were on peaceful terms with inhabitants of the Overworld for many years, even having permanent trade
                agreements with the ancient Bastaernians. However, when war from extra-dimensional invaders began to
                ravish the Nether, the portals connecting the two were severed, primarily due to the influence of Achaea
                and the Tiberians. Ever since being abandoned in their time of need, Piglins have held a deep distrust
                and hatred of humanity. The written language of the Piglins was scarcely used even in ancient times, and
                is unheard of in present day, as such all most to all history is oral.</p>

            <h1>Culture</h1>
            <p>Piglin society can be broken into Clans and Houses. A House is a family unit, typically consisting of
                anywhere from ~10-40 members. A single member of the House is chosen to lead and represent them. A Clan
                is a collection of typically 3-9 Houses, with a single House Leader chosen to be a Clan Leader, with the
                other House Leaders acting as advisors. Leaders are chosen not just for strength, but for charisma,
                wisdom, and cunning. They are a nomadic species, unable to make permanent settlements in the hostile
                environment, and as such these groups will tend to skew on the lower population side.</p>
